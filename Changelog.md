## New configuration system!

Copy over config/diaspora.yml.example to config/diaspora.yml and migrate your settings! An updated Heroku guide including basic hints on howto migrate is [here](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-on-heroku).

The new configuration system allows all possible settings to be overriden by environment variables. This makes it possible to deploy heroku without checking any credentials into git. Read the top of `config/diaspora.yml.example` for an explanation on how to convert the setting names to environment variables.

### Environment variable changes:

#### deprectated

* REDISTOGO_URL in favour of REDIS_URL or ENVIRONMENT_REDIS

#### removed

*  application_yml - Obsolete, all settings are settable via environment variables now

#### renamed

* SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* SINGLE_PROCESS -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* NO_SSL -> ENVIRONMENT_REQUIRE_SSL
* ASSET_HOST -> ENVIRONMENT_ASSETS_HOST

## Publisher

Refactoring of the JavaScript code; it is now completely rewritten to make use of Backbone.js.
This paves the way for future improvements such as post preview or edit toolbar/help.


## Removal of 'beta' code

The feature-flag on users and all the code in connection with experimental UX changes got removed/reverted. Those are the parts that became Makr.io.
The single-post view will also be revamped/reverted, but that didn't make it into this release.


## JS lib updates


## Cleanup in maintenance scripts and automated build environment
