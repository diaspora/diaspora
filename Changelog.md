## Refactor

### Replaced Resque with Sidekiq - Migration guide - [#3993](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/3993)

We replaced our queue system with Sidekiq. You might know that Resque needs Redis.
Sidekiq does too, so don't remove it, it's still required. Sidekiq uses a threaded
model so you'll need far less processes than with Resque to do the same amount
of work.

To update do the following:

1. Before updating (even before the `git pull`!) stop your application
   server (Unicorn by default, started through Foreman).
2. In case you did already run `git pull` checkout v0.0.3.4:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git checkout v0.0.3.4
   bundle
   ```

3. Start Resque web (you'll need temporary access to port 5678, check
   your Firewall if needed!):

   ```
   bundle exec resque-web
   ```

   In case you need it you can adjust the port with the `-p` flag.
4. One last time, start a Resque worker:

   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production QUEUE=* bundle exec rake resque:work
   ```

   Visit Resque web via http://your_host:5678, wait until all queues but the
   failed one are empty (show 0 jobs).
5. Kill the Resque worker by hitting Ctrl+C. Kill Resque web with:

   ```
   bundle exec resque-web -k
   ```

   Don't forget to close the port on the Firewall again, if you had to open it.
6. In case you needed to do step 2., run:

   ```
   git checkout master
   bundle
   ```

7. Proceed with the update as normal (migrate database, precompile assets).
8. Before starting Diaspora again ensure that you reviewed the new
   `environment.sidekiq` section in `config/diaspora.yml.example` and,
   if wanted, transfered it to your `config/diaspora.yml` and made any
   needed changes. In particular increase the `environment.sidekiq.concurrency`
   setting on any medium sized pod. If you do change that value, edit
   your `config/database.yml` and add a matching `pool: n` to your database
   configuration. n should be equal or higher than the amount of
   threads per Sidekiq worker. This sets how many concurrent
   connections to the database ActiveRecord allows.


If you aren't using `script/server` but for example passenger, you no
longer need to start a Resque worker, but a Sidekiq worker now. The
command for that is:

```
bundle exec sidekiq
```


#### Heroku

The only gotcha for Heroku single gear setups is that the setting name
to spawn a background worker from the unicorn process changed. Run

```
heroku config:remove SERVER_EMBED_RESQUE_WORKER
heroku config:set SERVER_EMBED_SIDEKIQ_WORKER=true
```

We're automatically adjusting the ActiveRecord connection pool size for you.

Larger Heroku setups should have enough expertise to figure out what to do
by them self.

### Removal of Capistrano

The Capistrano deployment scripts were removed from the main source code
repository, since they were no longer working.
They will be moved into their own repository with a new maintainer,
you'll be able to find them under the Diaspora* Github organization once
everything is set up.

## New configuration system!

Copy over config/diaspora.yml.example to config/diaspora.yml and migrate your settings! An updated Heroku guide including basic hints on howto migrate is [here](http://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installing_on_Heroku).

The new configuration system allows all possible settings to be overriden by environment variables. This makes it possible to deploy heroku without checking any credentials into git. Read the top of `config/diaspora.yml.example` for an explanation on how to convert the setting names to environment variables.

### Environment variable changes:

#### deprectated

* REDISTOGO_URL in favour of REDIS_URL or ENVIRONMENT_REDIS

#### removed

*  application_yml - Obsolete, all settings are settable via environment variables now

#### renamed

* SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* SINGLE_PROCESS -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* NO_SSL -> ENVIRONMENT_REQUIRE_SSL
* ASSET_HOST -> ENVIRONMENT_ASSETS_HOST

* airbrake
* newrelic_rpm
* rpm_contrib

The following gems were removed because their are neither used in daily development or are just CLI tools that aren't required to be loaded from the code:

* heroku
* oink
* yard


## Publisher

Refactoring of the JavaScript code; it is now completely rewritten to make use of Backbone.js.
This paves the way for future improvements such as post preview or edit toolbar/help.


## Removal of 'beta' code

The feature-flag on users and all the code in connection with experimental UX changes got removed/reverted. Those are the parts that became Makr.io.
The single-post view will also be revamped/reverted, but that didn't make it into this release.


## JS lib updates


## Cleanup in maintenance scripts and automated build environment
