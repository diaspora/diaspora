# 0.6.0.1

Fixes an issue with installing an running diaspora\*, caused by a recent bundler update that fixes a bundler bug on which we depended on.

# 0.6.0.0

## Warning: This release contains long migrations

This diaspora\* releases comes with a few database cleanup migrations and they could possible take a while. While you should always do that, it is especially important this time to make sure you run the migrations inside a detachable environment like `screen` or `tmux`. A interrupted SSH session could possibly harm your database. Also, please make a backup.

## The DB environment variable is gone

With Bundler 1.10 supporting optional groups, we removed the DB environment variable. When updating to this release, please update
bundler and select the database support you want:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install --with mysql # For MySQL and MariaDB
bundle install --with postgresql # For PostgreSQL
```

For production setups we now additionally recommend adding the `--deployment` flag.
If you set the DB environment variable anywhere, that's no longer necessary.

## Supported Ruby versions

This release recommends using Ruby 2.3, while retaining Ruby 2.1 as an officially supported version.
Ruby 2.0 is no longer officially supported.

## Configuration changes

Please note that the default listen parameter for production setups got
changed. diaspora\* will no longer listen on `0.0.0.0:3000` as it will now
bind to an UNIX socket at `unix:tmp/diaspora.sock`. Please change your local
`diaspora.yml` if necessary.

## Redis namespace support dropped

We dropped support for Redis namespaces in this release. If you previously set
a custom namespace, please note that diaspora\* will no longer use the
configured value. By default, Redis supports up to 8 databases which can be
selected via the Redis URL in `diaspora.yml`. Please check the examples
provided in our configuration example file.

## Terms of Use design changes

With the port to Bootstrap 3, app/views/terms/default.haml has a new structure. If you have created a customised app/views/terms/terms.haml or app/views/terms/terms.erb file, you will need to edit those files to base your customisations on the new default.haml file.

## API authentication

This release makes diaspora\* a OpenID Connect provider. This means you can authenticate to third parties with your diaspora\* account and let
them act as your diaspora\* account on your behalf. This feature is still considered in early development, we still expect edge cases and advanced
features of the specificiation to not be handled correctly or be missing. But we expect a basic OpenID Connect compliant client to work. Please submit issues!
We will also most likely still change the authorization scopes we offer and started with a very minimal set.
Most work still required is on documentation as well as designing and implementing the data API for all of Diaspora's functionality.
Contributions are very welcome, the hard work is done!

## Vines got replaced by Prosody

Due to many issues with Vines, we decided to remove Vines and offer a Prosody
example configuration instead. [Check the
wiki](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Integration/Chat#Vines_to_Prosody)
for more information on how to migrate to Prosody if you've been using Vines
before.

## Sidekiq queue changes

We've decreased the amount of sidekiq queues from 13 to 5 in PR [#6950](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/6950).
The new queues are organized according to priority for the jobs they will process. When upgrading please make sure to
empty the sidekiq queues before shutting down the server for an update.

If you run your sidekiq with a custom queue configuration, please make sure to update that for the new queues.

The new queues are: `urgent, high, medium, low, default`.

When you upgrade to the new version, some jobs may persist in the old queues. To move them to the default queue,
so they're processed, run:

```
bin/rake migrations:legacy_queues
```

Note that this will retry all dead jobs, if you want to prevent that empty the dead queue first.

The command will report queues that still have jobs and launch sidekiq process for that queues.

# 0.5.10.2

# 0.5.10.1

We made a mistake and removed `mysql2` from the `Gemfile.lock` in a recent gem update. Since this could cause some issues for some installations, we decided to release a hotfix.

# 0.5.10.0

## Refactor

# 0.5.9.1

Update Nokogiri to 1.6.8, which in turn updates libxml2 to 2.9.4 and libxslt to 1.1.29,
addressing a range of security issues. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/RCHyF5K9Lbc
for more details.

# 0.5.9.0

## Refactor

* Drop ChromeFrame and display an error page on old IE versions instead [#6751](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/6751)

# 0.5.7.1

This security release disables post fetching for relayables. Due to an insecure implementation, fetching of root posts for relayables could allow an attacker to distribute malicious/spoofed/modified posts for any person.

Disabling the fetching will make the current federation a bit less reliable, but for a hotfix, this is the best solution. We will re-enable the fetching in 0.6.0.0 when we moved out the federation into its own library and are able to implement further validation during fetches.

# 0.5.0.1

Use the correct setting for captcha length instead of defaulting to 1 always.

# 0.5.0.0

## Major Sidekiq update
This release includes a major upgrade of the background processing system Sidekiq. To upgrade cleanly:

1. Stop diaspora*
2. Run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec sidekiq` and wait 5-10 minutes, then stop it again (hit `CTRL+C`)
3. Do a normal upgrade of diaspora*
4. Start diaspora*

## Rails 4 - Manual action required
Please edit `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`, replacing `secret_token` with
`secret_key_base`.

```ruby
# Old
Rails.application.config.secret_token = '***********...'

# New
Diaspora::Application.config.secret_key_base = '*************...'
```

You also need to take care to set `RAILS_ENV` and to clear the cache while precompiling assets: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake tmp:cache:clear assets:precompile`

## Supported Ruby versions
This release drops official support for the Ruby 1.9 series. This means we will no longer test against this Ruby version or take care to choose libraries
that work with it. However that doesn't mean we won't accept patches that improve running diaspora* on it.

At the same time we adopt support for the Ruby 2.1 series and recommend running on the latest Ruby version of that branch. We continue to support the Ruby 2.0
series and run our comprehensive test suite against it.

## Change in defaults.yml
The default for including jQuery from a CDN has changed. If you want to continue to include it from a CDN, please explicitly set the `jquery_cdn` setting to `true` in diaspora.yml.

## Change in database.yml
For MySQL databases, replace `charset: utf8` with `encoding: utf8mb4` and  change `collation` from `utf8_bin` to `utf8mb4_bin` in the file `config/database.yml`.
This is enables full UTF8 support (4bytes characters), including standard emoji characters.
See `database.yml.example` for reference.
Please make sure to stop Diaspora prior running this migration!

## Experimental chat feature
This release adds experimental integration with XMPP for real-time chat. Please see  [our wiki](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Vines) for further informations.

## Change in statistics.json schema
The way services are shown in the `statistics.json` route is changing. The keys relating to showing whether services are enabled or not are moving to their own container as `"services": {....}`, instead of having them all in the root level of the JSON.

The keys will still be available in the root level within the 0.5 release. The old keys will be removed in the 0.6 release.

## New maintenance feature to automatically expire inactive accounts
Removing of old inactive users can now be done automatically by background processing. The amount of inactivity is set by `after_days`. A warning email will be sent to the user and after an additional `warn_days`, the account will be automatically closed.

This maintenance is not enabled by default. Podmins can enable it by for example copying over the new settings under `settings.maintenance` to their `diaspora.yml` file and setting it enabled. The default setting is to expire accounts that have been inactive for 2 years (no login).

## Camo integration to proxy external assets
It is now possible to enable an automatic proxying of external assets, for example images embedded via Markdown or OpenGraph thumbnails loaded from insecure third party servers through a [Camo proxy](https://github.com/atmos/camo).

This is disabled by default since it requires the installation of additional packages and might cause some traffic. Check the [wiki page](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation/Camo) for more information and detailed installation instructions.

## Paypal unhosted button and currency
Podmins can now set the currency for donations, and use an unhosted button if they can't use
a hosted one. Note: you need to **copy the new settings from diaspora.yml.example to your
diaspora.yml file**. The existing settings from 0.4.x and before will not work any more.

## Custom splash page changes
diaspora* no longer adds a `div.container` to wrap custom splash pages. This adds the ability for podmins to write home pages using Bootstrap's fluid design. Podmins who added a custom splash page in `app/views/home/_show.{html,mobile}.haml` need to wrap the contents into a `div.container` to keep the old design. You will find updated examples [in our wiki](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Custom_splash_page).

## New 'Terms of Service' feature and template

This release brings a new ToS feature that allows pods to easily display to users the terms of service they are operating on. This feature is not enabled by default. If you want to enable it, please add under `settings` in `config/diaspora.yml` the following and restart diaspora. If in doubt see `config/diaspora.yml.example`:

    terms:
      enable: true

When enabled, the footer and sidebar will have a link to terms page, and sign up will have a disclaimer indicating that creating an account means the user accepts the terms of use.

While the project itself doesn't restrict what kind of terms pods run on, we realize not all podmins want to spend time writing them from scratch. Thus there is a basic ToS template included that will be used unless a custom one available.

To modify (or completely rewrite) the terms template, create a file called `app/views/terms/terms.haml` or `app/views/terms/terms.erb` and it will automatically replace the default template, which you can find at `app/views/terms/default.haml`.

There are also two configuration settings to customize the terms (when using the default template). These are optional.

* `settings.terms.jurisdiction` - indicate here in which country or state any legal disputes are handled.
* `settings.terms.minimum_age` - indicate here if you want to show a minimum required age for creating an account.

## Rake task to email users

There is a new Rake task `podmin:admin_mail` available to allow podmins to easily send news and notices to users. The rake task triggers emails via the normal diaspora mailer mechanism (so they are embedded in the standard template) and takes the following parameters:

1) Users definition

* `all` - all users in the database (except deleted)
* `active_yearly` - users logged in within the last year
* `active_monthly` - users logged in within the last month
* `active_halfyear` - users logged in within the last 6 months

2) Path to message file

* Give here a path to a HTML or plain text file that contains the message.

3) Subject

* A subject for the email

Example shell command (depending on your environment);

`RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake podmin:admin_mail['active_monthly','./message.html','Important message from pod']`

## Pod statistics
A new feature [has been added](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/4602) to allow pods to report extra statistics. Automatically after this code change, the route /statistics.json contains some basic data that was also available before via page headers (pod name, version, status of signups). But also, optionally podmins can enable user and post counts in the diaspora.yml configuration file. The counts are by default switched off, so if you want to report the total user, active user and local post counts, please edit your diaspora.yml configuration with the example values in diaspora.yml.example and uncomment the required lines as indicated.

## Ruby 2.0

We now recommend using Ruby 2.0 with Diaspora. If you're using RVM make sure to run:
```bash
rvm get stable
rvm install 2.0.0
cd ~/diaspora
git pull
cd - && cd ..
```

## Refactor

### Replaced Resque with Sidekiq - Migration guide - [#3993](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/3993)

We replaced our queue system with Sidekiq. You might know that Resque needs Redis.
Sidekiq does too, so don't remove it, it's still required. Sidekiq uses a threaded
model so you'll need far less processes than with Resque to do the same amount
of work.

To update do the following:

1. Before updating (even before the `git pull`!) stop your application
   server (Unicorn by default, started through Foreman).
2. In case you did already run `git pull` checkout v0.0.3.4:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git checkout v0.0.3.4
   bundle
   ```

3. Start Resque web (you'll need temporary access to port 5678, check
   your Firewall if needed!):

   ```
   bundle exec resque-web
   ```

   In case you need it you can adjust the port with the `-p` flag.
4. One last time, start a Resque worker:

   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production QUEUE=* bundle exec rake resque:work
   ```

   Visit Resque web via http://your_host:5678, wait until all queues but the
   failed one are empty (show 0 jobs).
5. Kill the Resque worker by hitting Ctrl+C. Kill Resque web with:

   ```
   bundle exec resque-web -k
   ```

   Don't forget to close the port on the Firewall again, if you had to open it.
6. In case you needed to do step 2., run:

   ```
   git checkout master
   bundle
   ```

7. Proceed with the update as normal (migrate database, precompile assets).
8. Before starting Diaspora again ensure that you reviewed the new
   `environment.sidekiq` section in `config/diaspora.yml.example` and,
   if wanted, transfered it to your `config/diaspora.yml` and made any
   needed changes. In particular increase the `environment.sidekiq.concurrency`
   setting on any medium sized pod. If you do change that value, edit
   your `config/database.yml` and add a matching `pool: n` to your database
   configuration. n should be equal or higher than the amount of
   threads per Sidekiq worker. This sets how many concurrent
   connections to the database ActiveRecord allows.


If you aren't using `script/server` but for example passenger, you no
longer need to start a Resque worker, but a Sidekiq worker now. The
command for that is:

```
bundle exec sidekiq
```


#### Heroku

The only gotcha for Heroku single gear setups is that the setting name
to spawn a background worker from the unicorn process changed. Run

```
heroku config:remove SERVER_EMBED_RESQUE_WORKER
heroku config:set SERVER_EMBED_SIDEKIQ_WORKER=true
```

We're automatically adjusting the ActiveRecord connection pool size for you.

Larger Heroku setups should have enough expertise to figure out what to do
by them self.

### Removal of Capistrano

The Capistrano deployment scripts were removed from the main source code
repository, since they were no longer working.
They will be moved into their own repository with a new maintainer,
you'll be able to find them under the Diaspora* Github organization once
everything is set up.

## New configuration system!

Copy over config/diaspora.yml.example to config/diaspora.yml and migrate your settings! An updated Heroku guide including basic hints on howto migrate is [here](http://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installing_on_Heroku).

The new configuration system allows all possible settings to be overriden by environment variables. This makes it possible to deploy heroku without checking any credentials into git. Read the top of `config/diaspora.yml.example` for an explanation on how to convert the setting names to environment variables.

### Environment variable changes:

#### deprecated

* REDISTOGO_URL in favour of REDIS_URL or ENVIRONMENT_REDIS

#### removed

*  application_yml - Obsolete, all settings are settable via environment variables now

#### renamed

* SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* SINGLE_PROCESS -> ENVIRONMENT_SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE
* NO_SSL -> ENVIRONMENT_REQUIRE_SSL
* ASSET_HOST -> ENVIRONMENT_ASSETS_HOST

### Removed gems

The following gems and their related files were removed as they aren't widely enough used to justify maintenance for them by the core developers. If you use them please maintain them in your fork.

* airbrake
* newrelic_rpm
* rpm_contrib
* heroku_san

The following gems were removed because their are neither used in daily development or are just CLI tools that aren't required to be loaded from the code:

* heroku
* oink
* yard


## Publisher

Refactoring of the JavaScript code; it is now completely rewritten to make use of Backbone.js.
This paves the way for future improvements such as post preview or edit toolbar/help.


## Removal of 'beta' code

The feature-flag on users and all the code in connection with experimental UX changes got removed/reverted. Those are the parts that became Makr.io.
The single-post view will also be revamped/reverted, but that didn't make it into this release.


## JS lib updates


## Cleanup in maintenance scripts and automated build environment
