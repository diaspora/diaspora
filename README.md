## Commit Guidlines
You are welcome to contribute, add and extend Diaspora however you see fit.  We will do our best to incorporate everything that meets our guidelines.

All commits must be tested, and after each commit, all tests should be green before a pull request is sent.  Please write your tests in Rspec or Test-Unit.

GEMS:  We would like to keep external dependencies unduplicated.  We're using Nokogiri, and Mongomapper, and EM::HttpRequest as much as possible.  We have a few gems in the project we'd rather not use, but if you can, use dependencies we already have.

# Diaspora

The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY.**
These instructions are for machines running [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org) or Mac OS X.  We are developing Diaspora for the latest and greatest browsers, so please update your Firefox, Chrome or Safari to the latest and greatest.

## Preparing your system
In order to run Diaspora, you will need to download the following dependencies (specific instructions follow):

- Build Tools - Packages needed to compile the components that follow.
- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) - The Ruby programming language.  (We're using **1.8.7**.  It comes preinstalled on Mac OS X.)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) - A snappy noSQL database.
- [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) - An encryption library.  (It comes preinstalled on Mac OS X and Ubuntu.)
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) - An Image processing library used to resize uploaded photos.
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - The fast version control system.

After you have Ruby installed on your system, you will need to get RubyGems, then install Bundler:

- [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/) - Source for Ruby gems.
- [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) - Gem management tool for Ruby projects.

**We suggest using a package management system to download these dependencies.  Trust us, it's going to make your life a lot easier.  If you're using Mac OS X, you can use [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/); if you're using Ubuntu, just use [Synaptic](http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/) (it comes pre-installed); if you're using Fedora simply use [yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/).  The instructions below assume you have these installed.**  

### Build Tools

To install build tools on **Ubuntu**, run the following (includes the gcc and xml parsing dependencies):

		sudo apt-get install build-essential libxslt1.1 libxslt1-dev libxml2

To install build tools on **Fedora**, run the following:

		sudo yum install libxslt libxslt-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel

To install build tools on **Mac OS X**, you need to download and install [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html).

### Ruby

To install Ruby 1.8.7 on **Ubuntu**, run the following command:

		sudo apt-get install ruby-full

At this time Fedora does not have Ruby 1.8.7. As a workaround it is possible to use [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) with a locally compiled Ruby installation. A semi automated method for doing this is available. It is highly recommended that you review the script before running it so you understand what will occur. The script can be executed by running the following command:

		./script/bootstrap-fedora-diaspora.sh

After reviewing and executing the above script you will need to follow the "MongoDB" section and then you should skip all the way down to "Start Mongo".


If you're on **Mac OS X**, you already have Ruby on your system.  Yay!

### MongoDB

To install MongoDB on **Ubuntu**, add the official MongoDB repository from this link:

http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages

For Lucid, add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

		deb http://downloads.mongodb.org/distros/ubuntu 10.4 10gen

And then run:
		sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install mongodb-stable

You can also run the binary directly by doing the following:

If you're running a 32-bit system, run `wget http://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.2.tgz`.  If you're running a 64-bit system, run `wget http://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-1.6.2.tgz`.

		# extract
		tar xzf mongodb-linux-i686-1.4.0.tgz
		# create the required data directory
		sudo mkdir -p /data/db
		sudo chmod -Rv 777 /data/
			

To install MongoDB on a x86_64 **Fedora** system, add the official MongoDB repository from MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/CentOS+and+Fedora+Packages) into /etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo:

		[10gen]
		name=10gen Repository
		baseurl=http://downloads.mongodb.org/distros/fedora/13/os/x86_64/
		gpgcheck=0
		enabled=1


Then use yum to install the packages:

		sudo yum install mongo-stable mongo-stable-server


If you're running a 32-bit system, run `wget http://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.2.tgz`.  If you're running a 64-bit system, run `wget http://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-1.6.2.tgz`.

		# extract
		tar xzf mongodb-linux-i686-1.4.0.tgz
		# create the required data directory
		sudo mkdir -p /data/db
		sudo chmod -Rv 777 /data/


To install MongoDB on **Mac OS X**, run the following:

		brew install mongo

### OpenSSL

If you're running either **Ubuntu**, **Fedora** or **Mac OS X** you already have OpenSSL installed!

### ImageMagick

To install ImageMagick on **Ubuntu**, run the following:

		sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagick9-dev

To install ImageMagick on **Fedora**, run the following:

		sudo yum install ImageMagick

To install ImageMagick on **Mac OS X**, run the following:

		brew install imagemagick

### Git

To install Git on **Ubuntu**, run the following:
		
		sudo apt-get install git-core

To install Git on **Fedora**, run the following:
		
		sudo yum install git


To install Git on **Mac OS X**, run the following:

		brew install git


### Rubygems

On **Ubuntu**, run the following:

		wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
		tar -xf rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
		cd rubygems-1.3.7
		sudo ruby setup.rb
		sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem

On **Fedora**, run the following:

		sudo yum install rubygems

On **Mac OS X**, RubyGems comes preinstalled; however, you might need to update it for use with the latest Bundler.  To update RubyGems, run `sudo gem update --system`.


### Bundler

After RubyGems is updated, simply run `sudo gem install bundler` to get Bundler.


## Getting Diaspora

		git clone http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora.git

If you have never used github before, their [help desk](http://help.github.com/) has a pretty awesome guide on getting setup.


## Running Diaspora

### Install required gems
To start the app server for the first time, you need to use Bundler to install Diaspora's gem depencencies.  Run `bundle install` from Diaspora's root directory.  Bundler will also warn you if there is a new dependency and you need to bundle install again.

### Start Mongo
If you installed the Ubuntu package, MongoDB should already be running (if not, run `service mongodb start`). If you installed the binary manually, run `sudo mongod` from where mongo is installed to start mongo.

If you installed the Fedora package, MongoDB will need to be started via `service mongodb start`. If you installed the binary manually, run `sudo mongod` from where mongo is installed to start mongo.

Diaspora will not run unless mongo is running.  Mongo will not run by default, and will need to be started every time you wish to use or run the test suite for Diaspora.

### Run the app server
Once mongo is running and bundler has finished, run `bundle exec thin start` from the root Diaspora directory.  This will start the app server in development mode[.](http://bit.ly/9mwtUw)

### Logging in
Run `rake db:seed:tom`, then login with user `tom` and password `evankorth`. More details in db/seeds/tom.rb.


### Testing
Diaspora's test suite uses [rspec](http://rspec.info/), a behavior driven testing framework.  In order to run the tests, run `bundle exec rspec spec`.
