## Installation

You don't have to install diaspora\* to use the network. There are many servers connected to diaspora\*s network which are open to anyone, and you can create an account on one of these servers. Have a look at our [tips for finding a home](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Choosing_a_pod), or you can just go straight to the [list of open servers](https://diaspora.fediverse.observer) to sign up.

Want to own your data and install diaspora\*? Whether you just want to try it out, want to install it on your server or want to contribute and need a development setup, our [installation guides](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation) will get you started!
