# Diaspora

The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social
network. [Diaspora Project](http://diasporaproject.org)

************************
Diaspora is currently going through a huge refactoring push, the code is changing fast!
If you want to do something big, reach out on IRC or the mailing list first, so you can contribute effectively <3333

**TL;DR**

## Are you a user?
You can get an account on any Diaspora pod(http://podupti.me or http://dspr.tk/a for a list of pods), or sign up for an invite
at the pod run by the original development team at https://joindiaspora.com

## Are you a developer?

Read on for how to get started.

**THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY.**
**IT IS FUN TO GET RUNNING, BUT EXPECT THINGS TO BE BROKEN.**

## Want an invite?

Diaspora is decentralized. You don't need an invite to joindiaspora.com to fully participate. Just choose your pod for example at http://podupti.me or http://dspr.tk/a If you still want one have a look at https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Invitations Or setup your own pod 

Even if you're not a programmer, we'd love for you to give Diaspora a spin; all suggestions and comments welcome!

## Contributing to Diaspora

###[An introduction to the source code](http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/An-Introduction-to-the-Diaspora-Source)
###[Issue tracker (bugs)](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) - Currently going through major cleanup
###[How to use git](http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow)

Here are a few good places to start:

- Run "rake spec" to run our [Rspec](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-i/) 
unit test suite.

- Run "rake cucumber" to run our [Cucumber](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/10/05/outside-in-development/)
integration test suite.

- Take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) and pick a bug.
Write a spec for it, so it's easy for another developer to fix it.

Catches must be tested, and all your tests should be green, 
unless you're marking an existing bug, before a pull request is sent.
Unit tests should be in Rspec, and integration tests should be in Cucumber.

Please make your changes in a branch to ensure that new commits to your master are 
not included in the pull request, and to make it easier for us to merge your commits.

Please do not rebase our tree into yours.
See [here](http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html)
for when to rebase.

We need you to fill out a
[contributor agreement form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/joindiaspora.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFdRTnY0TGtfaklKQXZNUndsMlJ2eGc6MQ)
before we can accept your patches.  This dual license agreement allows
us to release limited pieces of Diaspora under the MIT license.  You can find it
