  Today is the day that alpha invites for Diaspora are handed out.
  Chances are you were one of the first to support Diaspora.

  We are elated to offer you a first glimpse of our Alpha release. 
  We know there still are bugs and missing features, but we are excited by the progress we made in these short months.

  We would love your feedback, as it is the users of Diaspora which should drive what it becomes.

  For suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please use the "Feedback" link found on the left side of the page.
