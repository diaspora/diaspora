  You have been invited to Diaspora, an open social web.  We are building an interface to the social web that keeps sharing intuitive while putting it in context, making it easy to know who you are sharing with.
  We are elated to offer you a first glimpse of our Alpha release. 
  We know there still are bugs and missing features, but we are excited by the progress we made in these short months.

  We would love your feedback, as it is the users of Diaspora which should drive what it becomes.

  For suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please use the "Feedback" link found on the left side of the page.
