## Some notes about this file:
## - All comments start with a double #
## - All settings are commented out with a single #
##   To change the default settings, you need both to uncomment the lines
##   AND, in most cases, to change the value that is given.
## - Take care to keep proper quoting. All " must have a matching " at
##   the end of the same line. The same goes for '
## - The values true, false and numbers should have no quote marks.
##   Everything else should.
##
## You can set and/or override all these settings through environment variables
## with the following conversion rules:
## - Strip the top level namespace (configuration, production, etc.)
## - Build the path to the setting, for example environment.s3.enable
## - Replace the dots with underscores: environment_s3_enable
## - Convert to upper case: ENVIRONMENT_S3_ENABLE
## - Specify lists/arrays as comma-separated values
##
## - For example, on Heroku:
##   heroku config:set SERVICES_TWITTER_KEY=yourkey SERVICES_TWITTER_SECRET=yoursecret

## You need to change or at least review the settings in this section
## in order for your pod to work.
[configuration.environment]

## Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
## from the internet. This should be the URL you want to use to
## access the pod. So if you plan to use a reverse proxy, it should be
## the URL the proxy listens on. DO NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP!
## However changing http to https is okay and has no consequences.
## If you do change the URL, you will have to start again as the URL
## will be hardcoded into the database.
#url = "https://example.org/"

## Set the bundle of certificate authorities (CA) certificates.
## This is specific to your operating system.
## Examples (uncomment the relevant one or add your own):
## For Debian, Ubuntu, Archlinux, Gentoo (package ca-certificates):
#certificate_authorities = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
## For CentOS, Fedora:
#certificate_authorities = "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt"

## URL for a remote Redis (default="localhost").
## Don't forget to restrict IP access if you uncomment these!
#redis = "redis://example_host"
#redis = "redis://username:password@host:6379/0"
#redis = "unix:///tmp/redis.sock"

## Require SSL (default=true).
## When set, your pod will force the use of HTTPS in production mode.
## Since OAuth2 requires SSL, Diaspora's future API might not work if
## you're not using SSL. Also there is no guarantee that posting to
## services will be possible if SSL is disabled.
## Do not change this default unless you are sure!
#require_ssl = true

## Single-process mode (default=false).
## If set to true, Diaspora will work with just the appserver (Unicorn by
## default) running. However, this makes it quite slow as intensive jobs
## must be run all the time inside the request cycle. We strongly
## recommended you leave this disabled for production setups.
## Set to true to enable.
#single_process_mode = false

## Set redirect URL for an external image host (Amazon S3 or other).
## If hosting images for your pod on an external server (even your own),
## add its URL here. All requests made to images under /uploads/images
## will be redirected to https://images.example.org/uploads/images/
#image_redirect_url = "https://images.example.org"

## Pubsub server (default="https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/"").
## Diaspora is only tested against the default pubsub server.
## You probably don't want to uncomment or change this.
#pubsub_server = "https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/"

## Sidekiq - background processing
[configuration.environment.sidekiq]

## Number of parallel threads Sidekiq uses (default=5).
## If you touch this, please set the pool setting in your database.yml
## to a value that's at minimum close to this! You can safely increase
## it to 25 and more on a medium-sized pod. This applies per started
## Sidekiq worker, so if you set it to 25 and start two workers, you'll
## process up to 50 jobs in parallel.
#concurrency = 5

## Number of times a job is retried (default=10).
## There's an exponential effect to this: if you set this too high you
## might get too many jobs building up in the queue.
## Set it to 0 to disable it completely.
#retry = 10

## Lines of backtrace that are stored on failure (default=15).
## Set n to the required value. Set this to false to reduce Redis memory
## usage (and log size) if you're not interested in this data.
#backtrace = 15

## Number of jobs to keep in the dead queue (default=5000).
## Jobs get into the dead queue after they failed and exhausted all retries.
## Increasing this setting will increase the memory usage of Redis.
## Once gone from the dead queue, a failed job is permanently lost and
## cannot be retried manually.
#dead_jobs_limit = 1000

## Number of seconds a job remains in the dead queue (default=3628800 (six weeks)).
## Jobs get into the dead queue after they failed and exhausted all retries.
## Increasing this setting will increase the memory usage of Redis.
## Once gone from the dead queue, a failed job is permanently lost and
## cannot be retried manually.
#dead_jobs_timeout = 15552000 # 6 months

## Log file for Sidekiq (default="log/sidekiq.log")
#log = "log/sidekiq.log"

## Use Amazon S3 instead of your local filesystem
## to handle uploaded pictures (disabled by default).
[configuration.environment.s3]

#enable = true
#key = "change_me"
#secret = "change_me"
#bucket = "my_photos"
#region = "us-east-1"

## Use max-age header on Amazon S3 resources (default=true).
## When true, this allows locally cached images to be served for up to
## one year. This can improve load speed and save requests to the image
## host. Set to false to revert to browser defaults (usually less than
## one year).
#cache = true

[configuration.environment.assets]

## Serve static assets via the appserver (default=false).
## This is highly discouraged for production use. Let your reverse
## proxy/webserver do it by serving the files under public/ directly.
#serve = false

## Upload your assets to S3 (default=false).
#upload = false

## Specify an asset host. Ensure it does not have a trailing slash (/).
#host = "http://cdn.example.org/diaspora"

## Logger configuration
[configuration.environment.logging]

## Roll the application log on a daily basis (default=true).
#logrotate.enable = true

## The number of days to keep (default=7)
#logrotate.days = 7

## Enables the debug-logging for SQL (default=false)
## This logs every SQL-statement!
#debug.sql = true

## Enables the federation-debug-log (default=false)
## This logs all XMLs that are used for the federation
#debug.federation = true

## Settings affecting how ./script/server behaves.
[configuration.server]

## Where the appserver should listen to (default="unix:tmp/diaspora.sock")
#listen = "unix:tmp/diaspora.sock"
#listen = "unix:/run/diaspora/diaspora.sock"
#listen = "127.0.0.1:3000"

## Set the path for the PID file of the unicorn master process (default=tmp/pids/web.pid)
#pid = "tmp/pids/web.pid"

## Rails environment (default="development").
## The environment in which the server should be started by default.
## Change this to "production" if you wish to run a production environment.
#rails_environment = "production"

## Write unicorn stderr and stdout log.
#stderr_log = "log/unicorn-stderr.log"
#stdout_log = "log/unicorn-stdout.log"

## Number of Unicorn worker processes (default=2).
## Increase this if you have many users.
#unicorn_worker = 2

## Number of seconds before a request is aborted (default=90).
## Increase if you get empty responses, or if large image uploads fail.
## Decrease if you're under heavy load and don't care if some
## requests fail.
#unicorn_timeout = 90

## Embed a Sidekiq worker inside the unicorn process (default=false).
## Useful for minimal Heroku setups.
#embed_sidekiq_worker = false

## Number of Sidekiq worker processes (default=1).
## In most cases it is better to
## increase environment.sidekiq.concurrency instead!
#sidekiq_workers = 1

## Displays the location of a post in a map. Per default we are using the map
## tiles of the Heidelberg University (http://giscience.uni-hd.de).
## You also have the possibility to use the map tiles of https://www.mapbox.com
## which is probably more reliable. There you have to create an account to get
## an access token which is limited. If you want to get an unlimited account
## you can write an email to team@diasporafoundation.org.
## Please enable mapbox and fill out your access_token.

## Settings potentially affecting the privacy of your users.
[configuration.privacy]

## Include jQuery from jquery.com's CDN (default=false).
## Enabling this can reduce traffic and speed up load time since most
## clients already have this one cached. When set to false (the default),
## the jQuery library will be loaded from your pod's own resources.
#jquery_cdn = false

## Google Analytics (disabled by default).
## Provide a key to enable tracking by Google Analytics.
#google_analytics_key = "yourkey"

## Piwik Tracking (disabled by default).

## Use Camo to proxy embedded remote images.
## Do not enable this setting unless you have a working Camo setup. Using
## camo to proxy embedded images will improve the privacy and security of
## your pod's frontend, but it will increase the traffic on your server.
## Check out https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation/Camo for
## more details and installation instructions.
[configuration.privacy.camo]

## Proxy images embedded via markdown (default=false).
## Embedded images are quite often from non-SSL sites and may cause a
## partial content warning, so this is recommended.
#proxy_markdown_images = true

## Proxy Open Graph thumbnails (default=false).
## Open Graph thumbnails may or may not be encrypted and loaded from
## servers outside the network. Recommended.
#proxy_opengraph_thumbnails = true

## Proxy remote pod's images (default=false).
## Profile pictures and photos from other pods usually are encrypted,
## so enabling this is only useful if you want to avoid HTTP requests to
## third-party servers. This will create a lot of traffic on your camo
## instance. You have been warned.

## NOTE! The default terms have not been checked over by a lawyer and
## thus are unlikely to provide full legal protection for all situations
## for a podmin using them. They are also not specific to all countries
## and jurisdictions. If you are unsure, please check with a lawyer.
## We provide these for podmins as some basic rules that podmins

## CSP (Content Security Policy) header
## CSP allows limiting origins from where resources are allowed to be loaded. This
## improves security, since it helps to detect and mitigate cross-site scripting
## and data injection attacks. The default policy of diaspora* allows all third
## party domains from services that are included in diaspora*, like OEmbed
## scripts, so you can safely activate it by setting `report_only` to false. If
## you customized diaspora* (edited templates or added own JS), additional work
## may be required. You can test the policy with the `report_uri`. Our default CSP
## does not work with Google analytics or Piwik, because they inject JS code that
## is blocked by CSP.
[configuration.settings.csp]

## Report-Only header (default=false)
## By default diaspora* adds a "Content-Security-Policy" header. If you set
## this to true, the "Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only" header is added instead.
