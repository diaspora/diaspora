## Some notes about this file:
## - All comments start with a double #
## - All settings are commented out with a single #
##   To change the default settings, you need both to uncomment the lines
##   AND, in most cases, to change the value that is given.
## - Take care to keep proper indentation, that is by simply deleting
##   the original #, with no additional space before the setting's name.
## - Take care to keep proper quoting. All ' must have a matching ' at
##   the end of the same line. The same goes for "
## - Lines containing "## Section" are section headings. Do not edit them!
## - Lists need the space after the -
## - The values true, false and numbers should have no quote marks.
##   Single words don't need quote marks, but it doesn't do any harm to have them.
##
## You can set and/or override all these settings through environment variables
## with the following conversion rules:
## - Strip the top level namespace (configuration, production, etc.)
## - Build the path to the setting, for example environment.s3.enable
## - Replace the dots with underscores: environment_s3_enable
## - Convert to upper case: ENVIRONMENT_S3_ENABLE
## - Specify lists/arrays as comma-separated values
##
## - For example, on Heroku:
##   heroku config:set SERVICES_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=yourappid SERVICES_FACEBOOK_SECRET=yourappsecret

configuration: ## Section

  ## You need to change or at least review the settings in this section
  ## in order for your pod to work.
  environment: ## Section

    ## Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
    ## from the internet. This should be the URL you want to use to
    ## access the pod. So if you plan to use a reverse proxy, it should be
    ## the URL the proxy listens on. DO NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP!
    ## However changing http to https is okay and has no consequences.
    ## If you do change the URL, you will have to start again as the URL
    ## will be hardcoded into the database.
    #url: "https://example.org/"

    ## Set the bundle of certificate authorities (CA) certificates.
    ## This is specific to your operating system.
    ## Examples (uncomment the relevant one or add your own):
    ## For Debian, Ubuntu, Archlinux, Gentoo (package ca-certificates):
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
    ## For CentOS, Fedora:
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt'

    ## URL for a remote Redis (default=localhost).
    ## Don't forget to restrict IP access if you uncomment these!
    #redis: 'redis://example_host'
    #redis: 'redis://username:password@host:6379/0'
    #redis: 'unix:///tmp/redis.sock'

    ## Require SSL (default=true).
    ## When set, your pod will force the use of HTTPS in production mode.
    ## Since OAuth2 requires SSL, Diaspora's future API might not work if
    ## you're not using SSL. Also there is no guarantee that posting to
    ## services will be possible if SSL is disabled.
    ## Do not change this default unless you are sure!
    #require_ssl: true

    ## Single-process mode (default=false).
    ## If set to true, Diaspora will work with just the appserver (Unicorn by
    ## default) running. However, this makes it quite slow as intensive jobs
    ## must be run all the time inside the request cycle. We strongly
    ## recommended you leave this disabled for production setups.
    ## Set to true to enable.
    #single_process_mode: false

    ## Sidekiq - background processing
    sidekiq: ## Section

      ## Number of parallel threads Sidekiq uses (default=5).
      ## If you touch this, please set the pool setting in your database.yml
      ## to a value that's at minimum close to this! You can safely increase
      ## it to 25 and more on a medium-sized pod. This applies per started
      ## Sidekiq worker, so if you set it to 25 and start two workers, you'll
      ## process up to 50 jobs in parallel.
      #concurrency: 5

      ## Number of times a job is retried (default=10).
      ## There's an exponential effect to this: if you set this too high you
      ## might get too many jobs building up in the queue.
      ## Set it to false to disable it completely.
      #retry: 10

      ## Lines of backtrace that are stored on failure (default=15).
      ## Set n to the required value. Set this to false to reduce Redis memory
      ## usage (and log size) if you're not interested in this data.
      #backtrace: 15

      ## Number of jobs to keep in the dead queue (default=5000).
      ## Jobs get into the dead queue after they failed and exhausted all retries.
      ## Increasing this setting will increase the memory usage of Redis.
      ## Once gone from the dead queue, a failed job is permanently lost and
      ## cannot be retried manually.
      # dead_jobs_limit: 1000

      ## Number of seconds a job remains in the dead queue (default=3628800 (six weeks)).
      ## Jobs get into the dead queue after they failed and exhausted all retries.
      ## Increasing this setting will increase the memory usage of Redis.
      ## Once gone from the dead queue, a failed job is permanently lost and
      ## cannot be retried manually.
      # dead_jobs_timeout: 15552000 # 6 months

      ## Log file for Sidekiq (default="log/sidekiq.log")
      #log: "log/sidekiq.log"

    ## Use Amazon S3 instead of your local filesystem
    ## to handle uploaded pictures (disabled by default).
    s3: ## Section

      #key: 'change_me'
      #secret: 'change_me'
      #bucket: 'my_photos'
      #region: 'us-east-1'

      ## Use max-age header on Amazon S3 resources (default=true).
      ## When true, this allows locally cached images to be served for up to
      ## one year. This can improve load speed and save requests to the image
      ## host. Set to false to revert to browser defaults (usually less than
      ## one year).
      #cache : true

    ## Set redirect URL for an external image host (Amazon S3 or other).
    ## If hosting images for your pod on an external server (even your own),
    ## add its URL here. All requests made to images under /uploads/images
    ## will be redirected to https://yourhost.tld/uploads/images/
    #image_redirect_url: 'https://images.example.org'

    assets: ## Section

      ## Serve static assets via the appserver (default=false).
      ## This is highly discouraged for production use. Let your reverse
      ## proxy/webserver do it by serving the files under public/ directly.
      #serve: false

      ## Upload your assets to S3 (default=false).
      #upload: false

      ## Specify an asset host. Ensure it does not have a trailing slash (/).
      #host: http://cdn.example.org/diaspora

    ## Pubsub server (default='https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/').
    ## Diaspora is only tested against the default pubsub server.
    ## You probably don't want to uncomment or change this.
    #pubsub_server: 'https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/'

    #listen: 'unix:/run/diaspora/diaspora.sock'
    #listen: '127.0.0.1:3000'

    ## Set the path for the PID file of the unicorn master process (default=none)
    #pid: '/run/diaspora/diaspora.pid'

    ## Rails environment (default='development').
    ## The environment in which the server should be started by default.
    ## Change this to 'production' if you wish to run a production environment.
    #rails_environment: 'development'

    ## Write unicorn stderr and stdout log.
    #stderr_log: '/usr/local/app/diaspora/log/unicorn-stderr.log'
    #stdout_log: '/usr/local/app/diaspora/log/unicorn-stdout.log'

    ## Number of Unicorn worker processes (default=2).
    ## Increase this if you have many users.
    #unicorn_worker: 2

    ## Number of seconds before a request is aborted (default=90).
    ## Increase if you get empty responses, or if large image uploads fail.
    ## Decrease if you're under heavy load and don't care if some
    ## requests fail.
    #unicorn_timeout: 90

    ## Embed a Sidekiq worker inside the unicorn process (default=false).
    ## Useful for minimal Heroku setups.
    #embed_sidekiq_worker: false

    ## Number of Sidekiq worker processes (default=1).
    ## In most cases it is better to
    ## increase environment.sidekiq.concurrency instead!
    #sidekiq_workers: 1

  ## Diaspora has an internal XMPP web-client. If you want to enable the chat

  ## Settings related to relays
  relay: ## Section

    ## Relays are applications that exist to push public posts around to
    ## pods which want to subscribe to them but would not otherwise
    ## receive them due to not having direct contact with the remote pods.
    ##
    ## See more regarding relays: https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Relay_servers_for_public_posts

    outbound: ## Section
      ## Enable this setting to send out public posts from this pod to a relay
      #send: false
      ## Change default remote relay url used for sending out here
      #url: 'https://relay.iliketoast.net/receive/public'

    inbound: ## Section
      ## Enable this to receive public posts from relays
      #subscribe: false

      ## Scope is either 'all' or 'tags' (default).
      ## - 'all', means this pod wants to receive all public posts from a relay
      ## - 'tags', means this pod wants only posts tagged with certain tags
      #scope: tags

      ## If scope is 'tags', should we include tags that users on this pod follow?
      ## These are added in addition to 'pod_tags', if set.
      #include_user_tags: false

      ## If scope is 'tags', a comma separated list of tags here can be set.
      ## For example "linux,diaspora", to receive posts related to these tags
      #pod_tags:

## Here you can override settings defined above if you need
