## Some notes about this file:
## - All comments start with a double #
## - All settings are commented out with a single #
##   To change the default settings, you need both to uncomment the lines
##   AND, in most cases, to change the value that is given.
## - Take care to keep proper indentation, that is by simply deleting
##   the original #, with no additional space before the setting's name.
## - Take care to keep proper quoting. All ' must have a matching ' at
##   the end of the same line. The same goes for "
## - Lines containing "## Section" are section headings. Do not edit them!
## - Lists need the space after the -
## - The values true, false and numbers should have no quote marks.
##   Single words don't need quote marks, but it doesn't do any harm to have them.
##
## You can set and/or override all these settings through environment variables
## with the following conversion rules:
## - Strip the top level namespace (configuration, production, etc.)
## - Build the path to the setting, for example environment.s3.enable
## - Replace the dots with underscores: environment_s3_enable
## - Convert to upper case: ENVIRONMENT_S3_ENABLE
## - Specify lists/arrays as comma-separated values
##
## - For example, on Heroku:
##   heroku config:set SERVICES_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=yourappid SERVICES_FACEBOOK_SECRET=yourappsecret

configuration: ## Section
  
  ## You need to change or at least review the settings in this section
  ## in order for your pod to work
  environment: ## Section
    
    ## Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
    ## from the internet. This should be the URL you want to use to
    ## access the pod. So if you plan to use a reverse proxy, it should be
    ## the URL the proxy listens on. DO NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP!
    ## However changing http to https is okay and has no consequences.
    ## If you do change the URL, you will have to start again as the URL
    ## will be hardcoded into the database.
    #url: "https://example.org/"
    
    ## Set the bundle of certificate authorities (CA) certificates.
    ## This is specific to your operating system.
    ## Examples (uncomment the relevant one or add your own):
    ## For Debian, Ubuntu, Archlinux, Gentoo (package ca-certificates):
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
    ## For CentOS, Fedora:
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt'
    
    ## URL for a remote Redis (default=localhost)
    ## Don't forget to restrict IP access if you uncomment these!
    #redis: 'redis://example_host'
    #redis: 'redis://username:password@host:6379/0'
    #redis: 'unix:///tmp/redis.sock'
    
    ## Require SSL (default=true)
    ## When set, your pod will force the use of HTTPS in production mode. Since
    ## OAuth2 requires SSL Diaspora's future API might not work if you're not using
    ## SSL. Also there is no guarantee that posting to services will be possible
    ## if SSL is disabled. Do not change this default unless you are sure!
    #require_ssl: true
    
    ## Single-process mode (default=false)
    ## If set to true Diaspora will work with just the appserver (Unicorn by default)
    ## running. However, this makes it quite slow as intensive jobs must be run
    ## all the time inside the request cycle. We strongly recommended you leave
    ## this disabled for production setups. Set to true to enable.
    #single_process_mode: false

    ## Sidekiq - background processing
    sidekiq: ## Section

      ## Number of parallel threads Sidekiq uses (default=5)
      ## If you touch this please set the pool setting in your database.yml to
      ## a value that's at minimum close to this! You can safely increase it 
      ## to 25 and more on a medium-sized pod. This applies per started Sidekiq
      ## worker, so if you set it to 25 and start two workers you'll process
      ## up to 50 jobs in parallel.
      #concurrency: 5

      ## Number of times a job is retried (default=10)
      ## There's an exponential effect to this: if you set this too high you
      ## might get too many jobs building up in the queue.
      ## Set it to false to disable it completely.
      #retry: 10

      ## Namespace to use in Redis. Useful if you need to run
      ## multiple instances of Diaspora using the same Redis instance.
      #namespace: "diaspora"

      ## Lines of backtrace that are stored on failure (default=15)
      ## Set n to the required value. Set this to false to reduce memory
      ## usage (and log size) if you're not interested in this data.
      #backtrace: 15

      ## Log file for Sidekiq (default="log/sidekiq.log")
      #log: "log/sidekiq.log"
    
    ## Use Amazon S3 instead of your local filesystem
    ## to handle uploaded pictures (disabled by default)
    s3: ## Section

      #enable: true
      #key: 'change_me'
      #secret: 'change_me'
      #bucket: 'my_photos'
      #region: 'us-east-1'

      ## Use max-age header on Amazon S3 resources (default=true)
      ## When true, this allows locally cached images to be served for up to
      ## 1 year. This can improve load speed and save requests to the image host.
      ## Set to false to revert to browser defaults (usually less than 1 year).
      #cache : true
    
    ## Set redirect URL for an external image host (Amazon S3 or other)
    ## If hosting images for your pod on an external server (even your own),
    ## add its URL here. All requests made to images under /uploads/images
    ## will be redirected to https://yourhost.tld/uploads/images/
    #image_redirect_url: 'https://images.example.org'
    
    assets: ## Section

      ## Serve static assets via the appserver (default=false)
      ## This is highly discouraged for production use. Let your reverse
      ## proxy/webserver do it by serving the files under public/ directly.
      #serve: false
      
      ## Upload your assets to S3 (default=false)
      #upload: false
      
      ## Specify an asset host. Ensure it does not have a trailing slash (/).
      #host: http://cdn.example.org/diaspora

    ## Pubsub server (default='https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/')
    ## Diaspora is only tested against the default pubsub server.
    ## You probably don't want to uncomment or change this.
    #pubsub_server: 'https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/'
  
  ## Settings affecting how ./script/server behaves.
  server: ## Section

    ## The port on which the appserver should listen (default=3000):
    #port: 3000

    ## Rails environment (default='development')
    ## The environment in which the server should be started by default.
    ## Change this if you wish to run a production environment.
    #rails_environment: 'development'
   
    ## Write unicorn stderr and stdout log
    #stderr_log: '/usr/local/app/diaspora/log/unicorn-stderr.log'
    #stdout_log: '/usr/local/app/diaspora/log/unicorn-stdout.log'
    
    ## Number of Unicorn worker processes (default=2)
    ## Increase this if you have many users.
    #unicorn_worker: 2

    ## Number of seconds before a request is aborted (default=90)
    ## Increase if you get empty responses, or if large image uploads fail.
    ## Decrease if you're under heavy load and don't care if some
    ## requests fail.
    #unicorn_timeout: 90
    
    ## Embed a Sidekiq worker inside the unicorn process (default=false)
    ## Useful for minimal Heroku setups.
    #embed_sidekiq_worker: false

    ## Number of Sidekiq worker processes (default=1)
    ## In most cases it is better to
    ## increase environment.sidekiq.concurrency instead!
    #sidekiq_workers: 1
  
  ## Settings potentially affecting the privacy of your users 
  privacy: ## Section
    
    ## Include jQuery from jquery.com's CDN (default=true)
    ## This can save you some traffic and speeds up load time since most
    ## clients already have this one cached. Set this to false if you want
    ## the jQuery library to be loaded from your pod's own resources.
    #jquery_cdn: true
    
    ## Google Analytics (disabled by default)
    ## Provide a key to enable tracking by Google Analytics 
    #google_analytics_key:
    
    ## Piwik Tracking (disabled by default)

      #count: 25
    
    ## Paypal donations
    ## You can provide the ID of a hosted Paypal button here to allow your users

    ## don't need to touch this unless explicitly told to.
    #typhoeus_verbose: false
  
    ## Maximum number of parallel HTTP requests made to other pods (default=20)

    ## NOTE! The default terms have not been checked over by a lawyer and
    ## thus are unlikely to provide full legal protection for all situations
    ## for a podmin using them. They are also not specific to all countries
    ## and jurisdictions. If you are unsure, please check with a lawyer.
    ## We provide these for podmins as some basic rules that podmins
    ## can communicate to users easily via the diaspora* server software.
    ## Uncomment to enable this feature.
