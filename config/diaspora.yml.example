## Some notes about this file:
## - All comments start with a double #
## - All settings are by default commented out with a single #
##   You need to uncomment them in order to work.
## - Take care to keep proper indentation, that is keeping the indentation
##   of the original #, with no additional space before the settings
##   name.
## - Take care to keep proper quoting. All ' should have a matching ' at
##   the end of the same line. Same goes for "
## - Lines containing "## Section" are sections, categories or however you
##   like to name them. Do not edit those!
## - Lists need the space after the -
## - true, false and numbers should have no quoting.
##   Single words could have none, but doesn't do any harm to them.
##
## You can set and/or override all this settings through environment variables
## with the following conversion rules:
## - Strip the top level namespace (configuration, production, etc.)
## - Build the path to the setting, for example environment.s3.enable
## - Replace the dots with underscores: environment_s3_enable
## - Upcase everything: ENVIRONMENT_S3_ENABLE
## - Specify lists/arrays as comma separated values

configuration: ## Section
  
  ## Settings you need to change or at least review
  ## in order for your pod to basically work
  environment: ## Section
    
    ## Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
    ## from the internet. This should be the URL you want to use to
    ## access the pod. So if you plan to  reverse proxy it, it should be
    ## the URL the proxy listens on.
    ## DO NOT CHNANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP
    ## UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
    ## However changing http to https is okay and has no consequences.
    ## If you do change it you have to start over as it's hardcoded into
    ## the database.
    #url: "https://example.org/"
    
    ## Setting the bundle of certificate authorities (CA) certificates.
    ## This is operating system specific.
    ## Examples, uncomment one or add your own:
    ## Debian, Ubuntu, Archlinux, Gentoo (package ca-certificates)
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
    ## CentOS, Fedora
    #certificate_authorities: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt'
    
    ## URL for a remote redis.
    ## Don't forget to restrict the IP access!
    ## Leave it commented out for the default (localhost)
    #redis: 'redis://exmaple_host'
    #redis: 'redis://username:password@host:6379/0'
    #redis: 'unix:///tmp/redis.sock'
    
    ## Require SSL, default true.
    ## When set, your pod will force you to use https in production.
    ## Since OAuth2 requires SSL Diasporas future API might not work if you're not
    ## on SSL. Also no gurantee that posting to services is given if SSL
    ## is disabled.
    #require_ssl: true
    
    ## Single process mode
    ## If set to true Diaspora will work with just the appserver,
    ## thin by default, running, however this makes it quite slow as
    ## all the time intensive jobs must be run inside the request cycle.
    ## So this is higly unrecommended for production setups.
    #single_process_mode: true

    ## Sidekiq - background processing
    sidekiq: ## Section
      ## Number of parallel threads Sidekiq uses
      ## If you touch this please set the pool setting
      ## in your database.yml to a value that's at minimum
      ## close to this! The default value is 5 but you can safely
      ## increase it to 25 and more on a medium sized pod.
      ## This applies per started Sidekiq worker, so if you set it to
      ## 25 and start two workers you'll process up to 50 jobs in parallel.
      #concurrency: 25

      ## Number of times a job is retried
      ## There's an exponential backoff, if you set this too
      ## high you might get too many jobs in the queue
      ## Set this to false to disable it completely 
      #retry: 10

      ## Namespace to use in Redis, useful if you need to run
      ## multiple instances of Diaspora using the same Redis instance
      #namespace: "diaspora"

      ## Lines of backtrace that is stored on failure
      ## Set this to false if you're not interested in this data to
      ## reduce memory usage (and log size)
      #backtrace: 15

      ## Log file for Sidekiq
      #log: "log/sidekiq.log"
    
    ## Use Amazon S3 instead of your local filesystem
    ## to handle uploaded pictures.
    s3: ## Section

      # Use max-age header on Amazon S3 resources.
      # this would set a max-age value of 1 year
      #cache : true
    
    ## Related to S3 you can set a url to redirect all requests to uploaded
    ## images to another host. If you for example set
    ## https://images.example.org here, all requests made to
    ## pictures under /uploads/images will be redirected to
    ## https://images.example.org/uploads/images/...
    #image_redirect_url: 'https://images.example.org'
    
    assets: ## Section
      ## Serve static assets via the appserver.
      ## This is highly discouraged for production use,
      ## let your reverse proxy/webserver do it by serving the files
      ## under public/ directly.
      #serve: true
      
      ## Upload your assets to S3
      #upload: true
      
      ## Specify an asset host. Ensure it does not have a trailing slash (/).
      #host: http://cdn.example.org/diaspora
    
    ## Diaspora is only tested against this default pubsub server.
    ## You likely don't want to change this.

  ## Settings affecting how ./script/server behaves.
  server: ## Section
    ## The port on which the appserver should listen

    #stdout_log: '/usr/local/app/diaspora/log/unicorn-stdout.log'
    
    ## The database type the server should use by default.
    ## Valid choices are 'mysql' and 'postgres'
    #database: 'mysql'
    
    ## Number of Unicorn worker processes, increase this if
    ## you have many users
    #unicorn_worker: 2

    ## Number of seconds before a request is aborted, increase if
    ## you get empty responses, or large image uploads fail.
    ## Decrease if you're under heavy load and don't care for some
    ## requests to fail.
    #unicorn_timeout: 90
    
    ## Embed a Sidekiq worker inside the unicorn process, useful for
    ## minimal Heroku setups
    #embed_sidekiq_worker: true

    ## Number of Sidekiq worker processes
    ## Most of the time you want to increase
