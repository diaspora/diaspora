Don’t expect much from these apps at the moment. There is currently no app for iOS. The best way to access diaspora* from your mobile device is through a browser, because we’ve designed a mobile version of the site which should work well on all devices, although it does not yet have complete functionality."

If you want to try it anyway, go to someone’s profile page and click the feed button in your browser, or you can copy the profile URL (e.g. https://podname.org/people/somenumber) and paste it into a feed reader. The resulting feed address looks like this: https://podname.org/public/username.atom – diaspora* uses Atom rather than RSS."

If neither of these methods work, enter their full diaspora* ID (username@podname.org). If your search doesn’t work the first time, it could be due to network latency. Try it again."
      use_search_box_q: "How do I use the search box to find particular individuals?"
      what_is_a_pod_a: "A pod is a server running the diaspora* software and connected to the diaspora* network. “Pod” is a metaphor referring to pods on plants which contain seeds, in the way that a server contains a number of user accounts. There are many different pods. You can add friends from other pods and communicate with them. There’s no need to open an account on different pods! One is enough – in this way, you can think of a diaspora* pod as similar to an email provider. There are public pods, private pods, and with some effort you can even run your own."

      char_limit_services_a: "In that case you should restrict your post to the smaller character count (140 in the case of Twitter; 1000 in the case of Tumblr), and the number of characters you have left to use is displayed when that service’s icon is highlighted. You can still post to these services if your post is longer than their limit, but the text will be truncated on those services with a link to the post on diaspora*."

      embed_multimedia_a: "You can usually just paste the URL (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnnnnnnnnnn ) into your post and the video or audio will be embedded automatically. The sites supported include: YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Flickr and a few more. diaspora* uses oEmbed for this feature. If you post a direct link to an audio or video file, diaspora* will embed it using standard HTML5 player. We’re supporting more media sources all the time. Remember to always post simple, full links – no shortened links; no operators after the base URL – and give it a little time before you refresh the page after posting for seeing the preview."
      embed_multimedia_q: "How do I embed a video, audio, or other multimedia content into a post?"
      format_text_a: "diaspora* uses a simplified system called %{markdown}. The publisher has buttons to make it easy to format your text. If you want to format your post manually, you can find the full Markdown syntax %{here}. The preview tab means you can see how your message will look before you share it. Remember that you can’t edit it once posted, so use the preview to make sure it’s perfect before pressing Share!"

      hide_posts_a: "If you point your mouse at the top of a post, an X appears on the right. Click it to hide the post and mute notifications about it. You can still see the post if you visit the profile page of the person who posted it."
      hide_posts_q: "How do I hide a post?"
      ignore_user_a1: "If you are currently sharing with that person, removing them from your aspects will stop many of their posts from appearing in your stream. A more complete method is to “ignore” that account. This will prevent any of their posts from appearing in your stream, and they will no longer be able to like or comment on your posts. They will, however, still be able to reshare your posts, comment on reshares of your posts, and their comments on posts by other people which appear in your stream will still be visible to you."
      ignore_user_a2: "To ignore an account, click the “ignore” icon (a circle with a diagonal line through it) at the top right of one of their posts. Their posts will instantly disappear from your stream. Alternatively, go to their profile page and click the ignore icon there. You will still be able to see their posts on their profile page, or by using the single-post view."

      insert_images_a: "If you want to include an image stored on your computer in your post, click the little camera icon at the bottom of the publisher. You can also drag and drop an image, or multiple images, from your computer onto that icon. If you want to insert an image from the web into your post, click the image button on the top of the publisher, which will create the Markdown code for you."
      insert_images_comments_a: "You can use Markdown to insert an image from the web into a comment, just like in posts. However, you cannot upload images from your computer directly into comments. Upload them to an image-hosting service and then insert them using the image button above the publisher."

      insert_images_q: "How do I insert images into posts?"
      post_location_a: "Click the pin icon next to the camera in the publisher. This will insert your location from OpenStreetMap. You can edit your location – you might only want to include the city you’re in rather than the specific street address."
      post_location_q: "How do I add my location to a post?"
      post_notification_a: "You will find a bell icon next to the X at the top right of a post. Click this to enable or disable notifications for that post."
      post_notification_q: "How do I get notifications, or stop getting notifications, about a post?"
      post_poll_a: "Click the graph icon to generate a poll. Type a question and at least two answers. Don’t forget to make your post public if you want everyone to be able to participate in your poll."
      post_poll_q: "How do I add a poll to my post?"
      post_report_a: "Click the alert triangle icon at the top right of the post to report it to your podmin. Enter a reason for reporting this post in the dialog box.

      post_report_q: "How do I report an offensive post?"
      size_of_images_a: "No. Images are resized automatically to fit the stream or single-post view. Markdown does not have a code for specifying the size of an image."
      size_of_images_q: "Can I customize the size of images in posts or comments?"
      stream_full_of_posts_a1: "Your stream is made up of three types of posts:"

      whats_in_profile_q: "What’s in my profile?"
      who_sees_profile_a: "Your basic profile (name, profile image and #tags) is public. Your extended profile is private by default, but you can make it all publicly accessible if you want. Only people you are sharing with (meaning, you have added them to one of your aspects) can see your extended profile if you keep it private. Other people will see only your public information. Any profile information you make public can be viewed by anyone using the web, and can be indexed by search engines"

      deselect_aspect_posting_a: "Deselecting aspects does not affect a public post. It will still be public and will appear in the streams of all of your contacts. To make a post visible only to specific aspects, you need to select those aspects from the aspect selector under the publisher."

      find_public_post_a: "Your public posts will appear in the streams of anyone following you. If you included #tags in your public post, anyone following those tags will find your post in their streams. Every public post also has a specific URL that anyone can view, even if they’re not logged in – thus public posts may be linked to directly from Twitter, blogs, etc. Public posts may also be indexed by search engines."
      find_public_post_q: "How can other people find my public post?"

      add_to_aspect_a2: "This is known as asymmetrical sharing. If and when Ben also adds Amy to an aspect then it would become mutual sharing, with both Amy’s and Ben’s public posts and relevant private posts appearing in each other’s streams, and Amy would be able to view Ben’s private profile.

        diaspora* has detected an attempt to access your session which might be unauthorised. To avoid any chance of your data being compromised, you have been signed out. Don’t worry; you can safely sign in again now.

        A request has been made using a incorrect or missing CSRF token. This might be completely innocent, but it could be a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

        This could have been caused by:

          - An add-on manipulating the request or making requests without the token;
          - A tab left open from a past session;
          - Another website making requests, with or without your permission;
          - Various other external tools;
          - Malicious code trying to access your data.

        For more information on CSRF see [%{link}](%{link}).

        If you see this message repeatedly, please check the points above, including any browser add-ons.

        Hello,

        It looks as though you no longer want your account at %{pod_url}, as you haven’t used it for %{after_days} days. To ensure our active users get the best performance from this diaspora* pod, we’d like to remove unwanted accounts from our database.

        We’d love you to stay part of diaspora*’s community, and you’re welcome to keep your account live if you want to.

        If you want to keep your account live, all you need to do is to sign in to your account before %{remove_after}. When you sign in, take a moment to have a look around diaspora*. It has changed a lot since you last looked in, and we think you’ll like the improvements we’ve made. Follow some #tags to find content you love.

        Sign in here: %{login_url}. If you’ve forgotten your sign-in details, you can ask for a reminder on that page.

        Hoping to see you again,

        The diaspora* email robot!
