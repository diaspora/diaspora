    account_and_data_management:
      close_account_a:  Go to the bottom of your settings page and click the “Close account” button. You will be asked to enter your password to complete the process. Remember, if you close your account, you will <strong>never</strong> be able to re-register your username on that pod.
      close_account_q:  How do I delete my seed (account)?
      data_other_podmins_a:  Once you are sharing with someone on another pod, any posts you share with them and a copy of your profile data are stored (cached) on their pod, and are accessible to that pod’s database administrator. When you delete a post or profile data it is deleted from your pod and a delete request is sent to any other pods where it had previously been stored. Your images are never stored on any pod but your own; only links to them are transmitted to other pods.
      data_other_podmins_q:  Can the administrators of other pods see my information?
      data_visible_to_podmin_a: ' In short: everything. Communication between pods is always encrypted (using SSL and diaspora*’s own transport encryption), but the storage of data on pods is not encrypted. If they wanted to, the database administrator for your pod (usually the person running the pod) could access all your profile data and everything that you post (as is the case for most websites that store user data). This is why we give you the choice which pod you sign up to, so you can choose a pod whose admin you are happy to trust with your data. Running your own pod provides more privacy since you then control access to the database.'
      data_visible_to_podmin_q:  How much of my information can my pod administrator see?
      download_data_a: ' Yes. At the bottom of the Account tab of your settings page you will find two buttons: one for downloading your data and one for downloading your photos.'
      download_data_q:  Can I download a copy of all of my data contained in my seed (account)?
      move_pods_a:  In the future you will be able to export your seed from a pod and import it on another, but this is not currently possible. You could always open a new account and add your contacts to aspects on that new seed, and ask them to add your new seed to their aspects.
      move_pods_q:  How do I move my seed (account) from one pod to another?
      title:  Account and data management
    aspects:
      change_aspect_of_post_a:  No, but you can always make a new post with the same content and post it to a different aspect.
      change_aspect_of_post_q:  Once I have posted something, can I change the aspect(s) that can see it?
      contacts_know_aspect_a:  No. They cannot see the name of the aspect under any circumstances.
      contacts_know_aspect_q:  Do my contacts know which aspects I have put them in?
      contacts_visible_a:  If you check this option then contacts from that aspect will be able to see who else is in it, in the “Contacts” tab on your profile page. It’s best to select this option only if the contacts in that aspect all know each other, for example if the aspect is for a club or society you belong to. They still won’t be able to see what the aspect is called.
      contacts_visible_q:  What does “make contacts in this aspect visible to each other” mean?
      delete_aspect_a:  Click “My aspects” in the side-bar from a stream view and click the pencil icon by the aspect you want to delete, or go to your Contacts page and select the relevant aspect. Then click the trash icon in the top right of the page.
      delete_aspect_q:  How do I delete an aspect?
      person_multiple_aspects_a:  Yes. Go to your contacts page and click on “My contacts”. For each contact you can use the menu on the right to add them to (or remove them from) as many aspects as you want. Or you can add them to a new aspect (or remove them from an aspect) by clicking the aspect selector button on their profile page. Or you can even just move the pointer over their name where you see it in the stream, and a “hovercard” will appear. You can change the aspects they are in right there.
      person_multiple_aspects_q:  Can I add a person to multiple aspects?
      post_multiple_aspects_a:  Yes. When you are making a post, use the aspect selector button to select or deselect aspects. “All aspects” is the default setting. Your post will be visible to all the aspects you select. You could also select the aspects you want to post to in the side-bar. When you post, the aspect(s) that you have selected in the list on the left will automatically be selected in the aspect selector when you start to make a new post.
      post_multiple_aspects_q:  Can I post content to multiple aspects at once?
      remove_notification_a:  No. They are also not notified if you add them to more aspects, when you are already sharing with them.
      remove_notification_q:  If I remove someone from an aspect, or all of my aspects, are they notified of this?
      rename_aspect_a:  Click “My aspects” in the side-bar from a stream view and click the pencil icon by the aspect you want to rename, or go to your Contacts page and select the relevant aspect. Then click the edit icon next to the aspect name at the top of this page, change the name and press “Update”.
      rename_aspect_q:  How do I rename an aspect?
      restrict_posts_i_see_a:  Yes. Click “My aspects” in the side-bar and then click individual aspects in the list to select or deselect them. Only the posts by people in the selected aspects will appear in your stream.
      restrict_posts_i_see_q:  Can I restrict the posts in my stream to just those from certain aspects?
      title:  Aspects
      what_is_an_aspect_a:  Aspects are the way you group your contacts on diaspora*. An aspect is one of the faces you show to the world. It might be who you are at work, or who you are to your family, or who you are to your friends in a club you belong to.
      what_is_an_aspect_q:  What is an aspect?
      who_sees_post_a:  If you make a limited post, it will only be visible to the people you had placed in that aspect (or aspects, if it is made to multiple aspects) before making the post. Contacts you have who aren’t in the aspect have no way of seeing the post. Limited posts will never be visible to anyone who you haven’t placed into one of your aspects.
      who_sees_post_q:  When I post to an aspect, who sees it?
    chat:
      add_contact_roster_a:  First, you need to enable chat for one of the aspects that person is in. To do so, go to the %{contacts_page}, select the aspect you want and click on the chat icon to enable chat for the aspect. %{toggle_privilege} You could, if you prefer, create a special aspect called “Chat” and add the people you want to chat with to that aspect. Once you’ve done this, open the chat interface and select the person you want to chat with.

      diaspora_app_a:  There have been several Android apps in development by community members. Some are long-abandoned projects and so do not work well with the current version of diaspora*. Don’t expect much from these apps at the moment. There is currently no app for iOS. The best way to access diaspora* from your mobile device is through a browser, because we’ve designed a mobile version of the site which should work well on all devices, although it does not yet have complete functionality.
      diaspora_app_q:  Is there a diaspora* app for Android or iOS?
      photo_albums_a:  No, not currently. However you can view a person’s uploaded pictures under the Photos tab of their profile page.
      photo_albums_q:  Are there photo or video albums?
      subscribe_feed_a: ' Yes, but this is still not a polished feature and the formatting of the results is still pretty rough. If you want to try it anyway, go to someone’s profile page and click the feed button in your browser, or you can copy the profile URL (e.g. https://podname.org/people/somenumber) and paste it into a feed reader. The resulting feed address looks like this: https://podname.org/public/username.atom – diaspora* uses Atom rather than RSS.'
      subscribe_feed_q:  Can I subscribe to someone’s public posts with a feed reader?
      title:  Miscellaneous
    pods:
      find_people_a: ' If you want to invite your friends to join diaspora*, use the invitation link or the email link in the side-bar. Follow #tags to discover others who share your interests, and add those who post things that interest you to an aspect. Shout out that you’re #newhere in a public post.'
      find_people_q:  I just joined a pod, how can I find people to share with?
      title:  Pods
      use_search_box_a:  If you know their full diaspora* ID (e.g. username@podname.org), you can find them by searching for it. If you are on the same pod you can search for just their username. Alternatively you can search for them by their profile name (the name you see on screen). If a search does not work the first time, try it again.
      use_search_box_q:  How do I use the search box to find particular individuals?
      what_is_a_pod_a:  A pod is a server running the diaspora* software and connected to the diaspora* network. “Pod” is a metaphor referring to pods on plants which contain seeds, in the way that a server contains a number of user accounts. There are many different pods. You can add friends from other pods and communicate with them. There’s no need to open an account on different pods! One is enough – in this way, you can think of a diaspora* pod as similar to an email provider. There are public pods, private pods, and with some effort you can even run your own.
      what_is_a_pod_q:  What is a pod?
    posts_and_posting:
      char_limit_services_a:  In that case you should restrict your post to the smaller character count (140 in the case of Twitter; 1000 in the case of Tumblr), and the number of characters you have left to use is displayed when that service’s icon is highlighted. You can still post to these services if your post is longer than their limit, but the text will be truncated on those services with a link to the post on diaspora*.
      char_limit_services_q:  What if I'm sharing my post with a connected service with a smaller character count?
      character_limit_a:  65,535 characters. That’s 65,395 more characters than you get on Twitter! ;)
      character_limit_q:  What is the character limit for posts?
      embed_multimedia_a: ' You can usually just paste the URL (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnnnnnnnnnn ) into your post and the video or audio will be embedded automatically. The sites supported include: YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Flickr and a few more. diaspora* uses oEmbed for this feature. We’re supporting more media sources all the time. Remember to always post simple, full links – no shortened links; no operators after the base URL – and give it a little time before you refresh the page after posting for seeing the preview.'
      embed_multimedia_q:  How do I embed a video, audio, or other multimedia content into a post?
      format_text_a:  By using a simplified system called %{markdown}. You can find the full Markdown syntax %{here}. The preview button is really helpful here, as you can see how your message will look before you share it.
      format_text_q:  How can I format the text in my posts (bold, italics, etc.)?
      hide_posts_a:  If you point your mouse at the top of a post, an X appears on the right. Click it to hide the post and mute notifications about it. You can still see the post if you visit the profile page of the person who posted it.
      hide_posts_q:  How do I hide a post?
      image_text:  image text
      image_url:  image url

      insert_images_comments_a2:  can be used to insert images from the web into comments as well as posts.

      insert_images_q:  How do I insert images into posts?
      post_location_a:  Click the pin icon next to the camera in the publisher. This will insert your location from OpenStreetMap. You can edit your location – you might only want to include the city you’re in rather than the specific street address.
      post_location_q:  How do I add my location to a post?
      post_notification_a:  You will find a bell icon next to the X at the top right of a post. Click this to enable or disable notifications for that post.
      post_notification_q:  How do I get notifications, or stop getting notifications, about a post?
      post_poll_a:  Click the graph icon to generate a poll. Type a question and at least two answers. Don’t forget to make your post public if you want everyone to be able to participate in your poll.
      post_poll_q:  How do I add a poll to my post?
      post_report_a:  Click the alert triangle icon at the top right of the post to report it to your podmin. Enter a reason for reporting this post in the dialog box.
      post_report_q:  How do I report an offensive post?
      size_of_images_a:  No. Images are resized automatically to fit the stream or single-post view. Markdown does not have a code for specifying the size of an image.
      size_of_images_q:  Can I customize the size of images in posts or comments?
      stream_full_of_posts_a1: ' Your stream is made up of three types of posts:'
      stream_full_of_posts_li1: ' Posts by people you are sharing with, which come in two types: public posts and limited posts shared with an aspect that you are part of. To remove these posts from your stream, simply stop sharing with the person.'
      stream_full_of_posts_li2:  Public posts containing one of the tags that you follow. To remove these, stop following that tag.
      stream_full_of_posts_li3:  Public posts by people listed in the community spotlight. These can be removed by unchecking the “Show community spotlight in stream?” option in the Account tab of your Settings.
      stream_full_of_posts_q:  Why is my stream full of posts from people I don’t know and don’t share with?
      title:  Posts and posting
    private_posts:
      can_comment_a:  Only logged-in diaspora* users you had placed in that aspect before making the private post can comment on or like it.
      can_comment_q:  Who can comment on or like my private post?
      can_reshare_a:  Nobody. Private posts are not resharable. Logged-in diaspora* users in that aspect can potentially copy and paste it, however. It’s up to you whether you trust those people!

      see_comment_a: ' Only the people that the post was shared with (the people who are in the aspects selected by the original poster) can see its comments and likes. '
      see_comment_q:  When I comment on or like a private post, who can see it?
      title:  Private posts

      who_sees_post_q:  When I post a message to an aspect (i.e., a private post), who can see it?
    private_profiles:
      title:  Private profiles
      whats_in_profile_a:  Your private profile contains your biography, location, gender, and birthday, if you have completed these sections. All this information is optional – it’s up to you whether you provide it. Logged-in users who you have added to your aspects are the only people who can see your private profile. When they visit your profile page they will also see the private posts that made to the aspect(s) they are in, mixed in with your public posts.
      whats_in_profile_q:  What’s in my private profile?
      who_sees_profile_a:  Any logged-in user that you are sharing with (meaning, you have added them to one of your aspects). However, people following you, but whom you do not follow, will see only your public information.
      who_sees_profile_q:  Who sees my private profile?
      who_sees_updates_a: ' Anyone in your aspects sees changes to your private profile. '

      can_comment_reshare_like_q:  Who can comment on, reshare, or like my public post?
      deselect_aspect_posting_a:  Deselecting aspects does not affect a public post. It will still be public and will appear in the streams of all of your contacts. To make a post visible only to specific aspects, you need to select those aspects from the aspect selector under the publisher.
      deselect_aspect_posting_q:  What happens when I deselect one or more aspects when making a public post?
      find_public_post_a: ' Your public posts will appear in the streams of anyone following you. If you included #tags in your public post, anyone following those tags will find your post in their streams. Every public post also has a specific URL that anyone can view, even if they’re not logged in – thus public posts may be linked to directly from Twitter, blogs, etc. Public posts may also be indexed by search engines.'
      find_public_post_q:  How can other people find my public post?
      see_comment_reshare_like_a:  Comments, likes, and reshares of public posts are also public. Any logged-in diaspora* user and anyone else on the internet can see your interactions with a public post.
      see_comment_reshare_like_q:  When I comment on, reshare, or like a public post, who can see it?
      title:  Public posts
      who_sees_post_a:  Anyone using the internet can potentially see a post you mark public, so make sure you really do want your post to be public. It’s a great way of reaching out to the world.
      who_sees_post_q:  When I post something publicly, who can see it?
    public_profiles:
      title:  Public profiles
      what_do_tags_do_a:  They help people get to know you. Your profile picture will also appear on the left-hand side of those particular tag pages, along with anyone else who has them in their public profile.
      what_do_tags_do_q:  What do the tags on my public profile do?
      whats_in_profile_a:  Your public profile contains your name, the five tags you chose to describe yourself, and your photo, if you have completed these sections. All this information is optional – it’s up to you whether you provide it. You can make this profile information as identifiable or anonymous as you like. Your profile page also shows any public posts you have made.
      whats_in_profile_q:  What’s in my public profile?
      who_sees_profile_a:  Any logged-in diaspora* user, as well as the wider internet, can see it. Each profile has a direct URL, so it may be linked to directly from outside sites. It may be indexed by search engines.
      who_sees_profile_q:  Who sees my public profile?
      who_sees_updates_a:  Anyone can see changes if they visit your profile page.
      who_sees_updates_q:  Who sees updates to my public profile?
    resharing_posts:

      reshare_private_post_aspects_q:  Can I reshare a private post to selected aspects?
      reshare_public_post_aspects_a:  No, when you reshare a public post it automatically becomes one of your public posts. To share it with certain aspects, copy and paste the contents of the post into a new, limited post.
      reshare_public_post_aspects_q:  Can I reshare a public post to selected aspects?
      title:  Resharing posts
    sharing:
      add_to_aspect_a1: ' Let’s say that Amy adds Ben to an aspect, but Ben has not (yet) added Amy to an aspect:'
      add_to_aspect_a2:  This is known as asymmetrical sharing. If and when Ben also adds Amy to an aspect then it would become mutual sharing, with both Amy’s and Ben’s public posts and relevant private posts appearing in each other’s streams, and Amy would be able to view Ben’s private profile. They would then also be able to send each other private messages.
      add_to_aspect_li1:  Ben will receive a notification that Amy has “started sharing” with Ben.
      add_to_aspect_li2:  Amy will start to see Ben’s public posts in her stream.
      add_to_aspect_li3:  Amy will not see any of Ben’s private posts.
      add_to_aspect_li4:  Ben will not see Amy’s public or private posts in his stream.
      add_to_aspect_li5:  But if Ben goes to Amy’s profile page, then he will see the private posts that Amy makes to the aspect that she has placed him in (as well as her public posts, which anyone can see there).
      add_to_aspect_li6:  Ben will be able to see Amy’s private profile (biography, location, gender, birthday).
      add_to_aspect_li7:  Amy will appear under “Only sharing with me” on Ben’s contacts page.
      add_to_aspect_li8:  Amy will also be able to @mention Ben in a post.
      add_to_aspect_q:  What happens when I add someone to one of my aspects, or when someone adds me to one of their aspects?
      list_not_sharing_a:  No, but you can see whether or not someone is sharing with you by visiting their profile page. If they are, the button showing the aspect(s) in which you have placed them will be green; if not, it’ll be gray.
      list_not_sharing_q:  Is there a list of people whom I have added to one of my aspects, but who have not added me to one of theirs?
      only_sharing_a: ' These are people that have added you to one of their aspects, but who are not (yet) in any of your aspects. In other words, they are sharing with you, but you are not sharing with them: you can think of this as them “following” you. If you add them to an aspect, they will then appear under that aspect and not under “Only sharing with me”. See above.'
      only_sharing_q:  Who are the people listed under “Only sharing with me” on my contacts page?
      see_old_posts_a:  No. They will only be able to see new posts to that aspect. They (and everyone else) can see your older public posts on your profile page, and they may also see them in their stream.
      see_old_posts_q:  When I add someone to an aspect, can they see older posts that I have already posted to that aspect?
      sharing_notification_a:  You should receive a notification each time someone starts sharing with you.
      sharing_notification_q:  How do I know when someone starts sharing with me?
      title:  Sharing
    tags:
      filter_tags_a:  This is not yet available directly through diaspora*, but some %{third_party_tools} have been written that might provide this.
      filter_tags_q:  How can I filter/exclude some tags from my stream?
      followed_tags_a: ' After searching for a tag you can click the button at the top of the tag’s page to “follow” that tag. It will then appear in your list of followed tags in the left-hand menu. Clicking one of your followed tags takes you to that tag’s page so you can see recent posts containing that tag. Click on #Followed Tags to see a stream of posts that include any one of your followed tags.'
      followed_tags_q:  What are “#Followed Tags” and how do I follow a tag?
      people_tag_page_a:  They are people who have listed that tag to describe themselves in their public profile.
      people_tag_page_q:  Who are the people listed on the left-hand side of a tag page?
      tags_in_comments_a:  A tag added to a comment will still appear as a link to that tag’s page, but it will not make that post (or comment) appear on that tag page. This only works for tags in posts.
      tags_in_comments_q:  Can I put tags in comments or just in posts?
      title:  Tags
      what_are_tags_for_a:  Tags are a way to categorize a post, usually by topic. Searching for a tag shows all posts, both public and private, with that tag that you have permission to see. This lets people who are interested in a given topic find public posts about it.
      what_are_tags_for_q:  What are tags for?

        Hello,

        It looks as though you no longer want your account at %{pod_url}, as you haven’t used it for %{after_days} days. To ensure our active users get the best performance from this diaspora* pod, we’d like to remove unwanted accounts from our database.

        We’d love you to stay part of diaspora*’s community, and you’re welcome to keep your account live if you want to.

        If you want to keep your account live, all you need to do is to sign in to your account before %{remove_after}. When you sign in, take a moment to have a look around diaspora*. It has changed a lot since you last looked in, and we think you’ll like the improvements we’ve made. Follow some #tags to find content you love.

        Sign in here: %{login_url}. If you’ve forgotten your sign-in details, you can ask for a reminder on that page.

        Hoping to see you again,

        The diaspora* email robot!
