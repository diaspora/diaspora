 Feature: embedding
     Get sure that embedding stuff actually works
 
     Background:
       Given a user with username "bob"
       When I sign in as "bob@bob.bob"
       And I am on the home page
 
     Scenario: Youtube is fully embedded
       Given I expand the publisher
       When I fill in "status_message_fake_text" with "Look at this awesome video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tq9g35kwk"
         And I press "Share"
         And I am on the aspects page
       Then I should see "Look at this awesome video: Youtube: Leekspin" within ".stream_element"
       When I follow "Youtube: Leekspin"
       And I wait for the ajax to finish
       Then I should see "Watch this video on YouTube" within ".video-container"
 
       #After ajax aspect switch
       When I follow "Besties" 
       And I wait for the ajax to finish
       And I follow "Youtube: Leekspin"
       Then I should see "Watch this video on YouTube" within ".video-container"
