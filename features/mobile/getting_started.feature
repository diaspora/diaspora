    Then I should see the 'getting started' contents

  Scenario: new user does not add any tags in setup wizard
    When I fill in the following:
      | profile_first_name | some name     |
    And I follow "awesome_button"
    Then I should be on the stream page
    And I should not see "awesome_button"

  Scenario: new user adds a profile photo and tags
    When I confirm the alert after I attach the file "spec/fixtures/bad_urls.txt" to "file" within "#file-upload"
    And I attach the file "spec/fixtures/button.png" to hidden "file" within "#file-upload"
    Then I should see a "img" within "#profile_photo_upload"
