The files in this directory are "source" files for the graphics used in
the Diaspora frontend.  This includes GIMP files, Photoshop files, SVG
files, and all other image files of this sort.  They are not shown directly
to end users, but are used to generate the actual graphics used in the
frontend (PNGs, etc.).  They can be scaled, tinted, shaded, etc.
