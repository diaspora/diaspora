# The Platform library offers a simple, reliable, means of
# determining what platform Ruby is running on.  Underlying
# Platform is the RUBY_PLATFORM constant.  This library is
# parsing this constant for information.  You could easily do
# this yourself.  We've just taken the hassle out of it for
# you and hopefully covered a few of the more unusual cases
# you mightn't have thought of yourself.
#
# On the other hand, if you've got cases we haven't please
# mail the authors.
