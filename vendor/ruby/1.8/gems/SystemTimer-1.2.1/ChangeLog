=== 1.2.1 / 2010-11-15

 * Better Rubinious support (Contributed by 
   Evan Phoenix <http://blog.fallingsnow.net/>)

=== 1.2 / 2010-02-25

 * Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Mutex causes thread join
   errors when Ruby is compiled with -disable-pthreads
	 (Contributed by Dmytro Shteflyuk <http://kpumuk.info/>)

 * Timeouts can now be specified as a float and be a fraction of a second.
   e.g. `SystemTimer.timeout(0.5)`
	 (Based on a contribution by Dmytro Shteflyuk <http://kpumuk.info/>)
 
 * Added support for custom timeout exception. Useful to avoid interference
   with other libraries using `Timeout::Error` (e.g. `Net::HTTP`)

          puts "hi there!"
