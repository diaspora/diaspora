  module Caching
    # Page caching is an approach to caching where the entire action output of is stored as a HTML file that the web server
    # can serve without going through Action Pack. This is the fastest way to cache your content as opposed to going dynamically
    # through the process of generating the content. Unfortunately, this incredible speed-up is only available to stateless pages
    # where all visitors are treated the same. Content management systems -- including weblogs and wikis -- have many pages that are
    # a great fit for this approach, but account-based systems where people log in and manipulate their own data are often less
    # likely candidates.
    #
    # Specifying which actions to cache is done through the <tt>caches_page</tt> class method:
    #
    #   class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    #     caches_page :show, :new
    #   end
    #
    # This will generate cache files such as <tt>weblog/show/5.html</tt> and <tt>weblog/new.html</tt>,
    # which match the URLs used to trigger the dynamic generation. This is how the web server is able
    # pick up a cache file when it exists and otherwise let the request pass on to Action Pack to generate it.
    #
    # Expiration of the cache is handled by deleting the cached file, which results in a lazy regeneration approach where the cache
    # is not restored before another hit is made against it. The API for doing so mimics the options from +url_for+ and friends:
    #
    #   class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    #     def update
    #       List.update(params[:list][:id], params[:list])
    #       expire_page :action => "show", :id => params[:list][:id]
    #       redirect_to :action => "show", :id => params[:list][:id]
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Additionally, you can expire caches using Sweepers that act on changes in the model to determine when a cache is supposed to be
    # expired.
