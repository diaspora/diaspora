      # Defines mime types that are rendered by default when invoking
      # <tt>respond_with</tt>.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #   respond_to :html, :xml, :json
      #
      # Specifies that all actions in the controller respond to requests
      # for <tt>:html</tt>, <tt>:xml</tt> and <tt>:json</tt>.
      #
      # To specify on per-action basis, use <tt>:only</tt> and
      # <tt>:except</tt> with an array of actions or a single action:
      #
      #   respond_to :html
      #   respond_to :xml, :json, :except => [ :edit ]
      #
      # This specifies that all actions respond to <tt>:html</tt>
      # and all actions except <tt>:edit</tt> respond to <tt>:xml</tt> and
      # <tt>:json</tt>.
      #
      #   respond_to :rjs, :only => :create
      #
      # This specifies that the <tt>:create</tt> action and no other responds

    # Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for displaying a list of people
    # might look something like this:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html
    #       format.xml { render :xml => @people.to_xml }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # What that says is, "if the client wants HTML in response to this action, just respond as we
    # would have before, but if the client wants XML, return them the list of people in XML format."
    # (Rails determines the desired response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)
    #
    # Supposing you have an action that adds a new person, optionally creating their company
    # (by name) if it does not already exist, without web-services, it might look like this:
    #
    #   def create
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(params[:company][:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     redirect_to(person_list_url)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def create
    #     company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html { redirect_to(person_list_url) }
    #       format.js
    #       format.xml  { render :xml => @person.to_xml(:include => @company) }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the client wants HTML, we just redirect them back to the person list. If they want Javascript
    # (format.js), then it is an RJS request and we render the RJS template associated with this action.
    # Lastly, if the client wants XML, we render the created person as XML, but with a twist: we also
    # include the person's company in the rendered XML, so you get something like this:
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <id>...</id>
    #     ...
    #     <company>
    #       <id>...</id>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #       ...
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
    #
    #   company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #   @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #
    # This is because the incoming XML document (if a web-service request is in process) can only contain a
    # single root-node. So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
    #
    #   person[name]=...&person[company][name]=...&...
    #
    # And, like this (xml-encoded):
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <name>...</name>
    #     <company>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity's person. Then, in the action,
    # we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person
    # with the remaining data.
    #
    # Note that you can define your own XML parameter parser which would allow you to describe multiple entities
    # in a single request (i.e., by wrapping them all in a single root node), but if you just go with the flow
    # and accept Rails' defaults, life will be much easier.
    #
    # If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in
    # config/initializers/mime_types.rb as follows.
    #
    #   Mime::Type.register "image/jpg", :jpg
    #
    # Respond to also allows you to specify a common block for different formats by using any:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html
    #       format.any(:xml, :json) { render request.format.to_sym => @people }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # In the example above, if the format is xml, it will render:
    #
    #   render :xml => @people
    #
    # Or if the format is json:
    #
    #   render :json => @people
    #
    # Since this is a common pattern, you can use the class method respond_to
    # with the respond_with method to have the same results:
    #
    #   class PeopleController < ApplicationController
    #     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
    #
    #     def index
    #       @people = Person.find(:all)
    #       respond_with(@person)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Be sure to check respond_with and respond_to documentation for more examples.

    # First it invokes respond_to, if a response cannot be found (ie. no block
    # for the request was given and template was not available), it instantiates
    # an ActionController::Responder with the controller and resource.
    #
    # ==== Example
    #
    #   def index
    #     @users = User.all
    #     respond_with(@users)
    #   end
    #

    #     flash[:notice] = "User was successfully created." if @user.save
    #
    #     respond_with(@user) do |format|
    #       format.html { render }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # All options given to respond_with are sent to the underlying responder,
    # except for the option :responder itself. Since the responder interface
    # is quite simple (it just needs to respond to call), you can even give
    # a proc to it.
