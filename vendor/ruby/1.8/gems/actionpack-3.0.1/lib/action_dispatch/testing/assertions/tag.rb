    module TagAssertions
      # Asserts that there is a tag/node/element in the body of the response
      # that meets all of the given conditions. The +conditions+ parameter must
      # be a hash of any of the following keys (all are optional):
      #
      # * <tt>:tag</tt>: the node type must match the corresponding value
      # * <tt>:attributes</tt>: a hash. The node's attributes must match the
      #   corresponding values in the hash.
      # * <tt>:parent</tt>: a hash. The node's parent must match the
      #   corresponding hash.
      # * <tt>:child</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's immediate children
      #   must meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * <tt>:ancestor</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's ancestors must
      #   meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * <tt>:descendant</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's descendants
      #   must meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * <tt>:sibling</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's siblings must
      #   meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * <tt>:after</tt>: a hash. The node must be after any sibling meeting
      #   the criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.
      # * <tt>:before</tt>: a hash. The node must be before any sibling meeting
      #   the criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.
      # * <tt>:children</tt>: a hash, for counting children of a node. Accepts
      #   the keys:
      #   * <tt>:count</tt>: either a number or a range which must equal (or
      #     include) the number of children that match.
      #   * <tt>:less_than</tt>: the number of matching children must be less
      #     than this number.
      #   * <tt>:greater_than</tt>: the number of matching children must be
      #     greater than this number.
      #   * <tt>:only</tt>: another hash consisting of the keys to use
      #     to match on the children, and only matching children will be
      #     counted.
      # * <tt>:content</tt>: the textual content of the node must match the
      #   given value. This will not match HTML tags in the body of a
      #   tag--only text.
      #
      # Conditions are matched using the following algorithm:
      #
      # * if the condition is a string, it must be a substring of the value.
      # * if the condition is a regexp, it must match the value.
      # * if the condition is a number, the value must match number.to_s.
      # * if the condition is +true+, the value must not be +nil+.
      # * if the condition is +false+ or +nil+, the value must be +nil+.
