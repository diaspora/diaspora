  module Caching
    # Action caching is similar to page caching by the fact that the entire
    # output of the response is cached, but unlike page caching, every
    # request still goes through Action Pack. The key benefit of this is
    # that filters run before the cache is served, which allows for
    # authentication and other restrictions on whether someone is allowed
    # to execute such action. Example:
    #
    #   class ListsController < ApplicationController
    #     before_filter :authenticate, :except => :public
    #
    #     caches_page   :public
    #     caches_action :index, :show
    #   end
    #
    # In this example, the +public+ action doesn't require authentication
    # so it's possible to use the faster page caching. On the other hand
    # +index+ and +show+ require authentication. They can still be cached,
    # but we need action caching for them.
    #
    # Action caching uses fragment caching internally and an around
    # filter to do the job. The fragment cache is named according to
    # the host and path of the request. A page that is accessed at
    # <tt>http://david.example.com/lists/show/1</tt> will result in a fragment named
    # <tt>david.example.com/lists/show/1</tt>. This allows the cacher to
    # differentiate between <tt>david.example.com/lists/</tt> and
    # <tt>jamis.example.com/lists/</tt> -- which is a helpful way of assisting
    # the subdomain-as-account-key pattern.
    #
    # Different representations of the same resource, e.g.
    # <tt>http://david.somewhere.com/lists</tt> and
    # <tt>http://david.somewhere.com/lists.xml</tt>
    # are treated like separate requests and so are cached separately.
    # Keep in mind when expiring an action cache that
    # <tt>:action => 'lists'</tt> is not the same as
    # <tt>:action => 'list', :format => :xml</tt>.
    #
    # You can set modify the default action cache path by passing a
    # <tt>:cache_path</tt> option.  This will be passed directly to
    # <tt>ActionCachePath.path_for</tt>.  This is handy for actions with
    # multiple possible routes that should be cached differently. If a
    # block is given, it is called with the current controller instance.
    #
    # And you can also use <tt>:if</tt> (or <tt>:unless</tt>) to pass a
    # proc that specifies when the action should be cached.
    #
    # Finally, if you are using memcached, you can also pass <tt>:expires_in</tt>.
    #
    # The following example depicts some of the points made above:
    #
    #   class ListsController < ApplicationController
    #     before_filter :authenticate, :except => :public
    #
    #     caches_page :public
    #
    #     caches_action :index, :if => proc do |c|
    #       !c.request.format.json?  # cache if is not a JSON request
    #     end
    #
    #     caches_action :show, :cache_path => { :project => 1 },
    #       :expires_in => 1.hour
    #
    #     caches_action :feed, :cache_path => proc do |c|
    #       if c.params[:user_id]
    #         c.send(:user_list_url,
    #           c.params[:user_id], c.params[:id])
    #       else
    #         c.send(:list_url, c.params[:id])
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If you pass <tt>:layout => false</tt>, it will only cache your action
    # content. That's useful when your layout has dynamic information.
    #
    # Warning: If the format of the request is determined by the Accept HTTP
    # header the Content-Type of the cached response could be wrong because
    # no information about the MIME type is stored in the cache key. So, if
    # you first ask for MIME type M in the Accept header, a cache entry is
    # created, and then perform a second resquest to the same resource asking
    # for a different MIME type, you'd get the content cached for M.
    #
    # The <tt>:format</tt> parameter is taken into account though. The safest
    # way to cache by MIME type is to pass the format in the route.
