    # == Active Model Lint Tests
    #
    # You can test whether an object is compliant with the Active Model API by
    # including <tt>ActiveModel::Lint::Tests</tt> in your TestCase. It will include
    # tests that tell you whether your object is fully compliant, or if not,
    # which aspects of the API are not implemented.
    #
    # These tests do not attempt to determine the semantic correctness of the
    # returned values. For instance, you could implement valid? to always
    # return true, and the tests would pass. It is up to you to ensure that
    # the values are semantically meaningful.
    #
    # Objects you pass in are expected to return a compliant object from a
    # call to to_model. It is perfectly fine for to_model to return self.
