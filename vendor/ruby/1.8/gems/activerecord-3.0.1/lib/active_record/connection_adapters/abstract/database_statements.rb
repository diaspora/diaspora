      #
      # == Nested transactions support
      #
      # Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
      # writing, the only database that supports true nested transactions that
      # we're aware of, is MS-SQL.
      #
      # In order to get around this problem, #transaction will emulate the effect
      # of nested transactions, by using savepoints:
      # http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/savepoints.html
      # Savepoints are supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL, but not SQLite3.
      #
      # It is safe to call this method if a database transaction is already open,
      # i.e. if #transaction is called within another #transaction block. In case
      # of a nested call, #transaction will behave as follows:
      #
      # - The block will be run without doing anything. All database statements
      #   that happen within the block are effectively appended to the already
      #   open database transaction.
      # - However, if +:requires_new+ is set, the block will be wrapped in a
      #   database savepoint acting as a sub-transaction.
      #
      # === Caveats
      #
      # MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions. If you perform a DDL operation,
      # then any created savepoints will be automatically released. For example,
      # if you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement,
      # then the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.
      #
      # This means that, on MySQL, you shouldn't execute DDL operations inside
      # a #transaction call that you know might create a savepoint. Otherwise,
      # #transaction will raise exceptions when it tries to release the
      # already-automatically-released savepoints:
      #
      #   Model.connection.transaction do  # BEGIN
      #     Model.connection.transaction(:requires_new => true) do  # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
      #       Model.connection.create_table(...)
      #       # active_record_1 now automatically released
      #     end  # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1  <--- BOOM! database error!
