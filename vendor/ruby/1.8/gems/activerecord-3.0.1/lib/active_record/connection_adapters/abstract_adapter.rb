    # Active Record supports multiple database systems. AbstractAdapter and
    # related classes form the abstraction layer which makes this possible.
    # An AbstractAdapter represents a connection to a database, and provides an
    # abstract interface for database-specific functionality such as establishing
    # a connection, escaping values, building the right SQL fragments for ':offset'
    # and ':limit' options, etc.
    #
    # All the concrete database adapters follow the interface laid down in this class.
    # ActiveRecord::Base.connection returns an AbstractAdapter object, which
    # you can use.
    #
    # Most of the methods in the adapter are useful during migrations. Most
    # notably, the instance methods provided by SchemaStatement are very useful.
