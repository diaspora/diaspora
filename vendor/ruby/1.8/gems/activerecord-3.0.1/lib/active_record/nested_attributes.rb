    class TooManyRecords < ActiveRecordError

    # = Active Record Nested Attributes
    #
    # Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records
    # through the parent. By default nested attribute updating is turned off,
    # you can enable it using the accepts_nested_attributes_for class method.
    # When you enable nested attributes an attribute writer is defined on
    # the model.
    #
    # The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that
    # in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:
    #
    # <tt>author_attributes=(attributes)</tt> and
    # <tt>pages_attributes=(attributes)</tt>.
    #
    #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :author
    #     has_many :pages
    #
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
    #   end
    #
    # Note that the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is automatically enabled on every
    # association that accepts_nested_attributes_for is used for.
    #
    # === One-to-one
    #
    # Consider a Member model that has one Avatar:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
    #   end
    #
    # Enabling nested attributes on a one-to-one association allows you to
    # create the member and avatar in one go:
    #
    #   params = { :member => { :name => 'Jack', :avatar_attributes => { :icon => 'smiling' } } }
    #   member = Member.create(params[:member])
    #   member.avatar.id # => 2
    #   member.avatar.icon # => 'smiling'
    #
    # It also allows you to update the avatar through the member:
    #
    #   params = { :member => { :avatar_attributes => { :id => '2', :icon => 'sad' } } }
    #   member.update_attributes params[:member]
    #   member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'
    #
    # By default you will only be able to set and update attributes on the
    # associated model. If you want to destroy the associated model through the
    # attributes hash, you have to enable it first using the
    # <tt>:allow_destroy</tt> option.
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :allow_destroy => true
    #   end
    #
    # Now, when you add the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to the attributes hash, with a
    # value that evaluates to +true+, you will destroy the associated model:
    #
    #   member.avatar_attributes = { :id => '2', :_destroy => '1' }
    #   member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # => true
    #   member.save
    #   member.reload.avatar # => nil
    #
    # Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.
    #
    # === One-to-many
    #
    # Consider a member that has a number of posts:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
    #   end
    #
    # You can now set or update attributes on an associated post model through
    # the attribute hash.
    #
    # For each hash that does _not_ have an <tt>id</tt> key a new record will
    # be instantiated, unless the hash also contains a <tt>_destroy</tt> key
    # that evaluates to +true+.
    #
    #   params = { :member => {
    #     :name => 'joe', :posts_attributes => [
    #       { :title => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { :title => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
    #       { :title => '', :_destroy => '1' } # this will be ignored
    #     ]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member = Member.create(params['member'])
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
    #
    # You may also set a :reject_if proc to silently ignore any new record
    # hashes if they fail to pass your criteria. For example, the previous
    # example could be rewritten as:
    #
    #    class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #      has_many :posts
    #      accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => proc { |attributes| attributes['title'].blank? }
    #    end
    #
    #   params = { :member => {
    #     :name => 'joe', :posts_attributes => [
    #       { :title => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { :title => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
    #       { :title => '' } # this will be ignored because of the :reject_if proc
    #     ]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member = Member.create(params['member'])
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
    #
    # Alternatively, :reject_if also accepts a symbol for using methods:
    #
    #    class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #      has_many :posts
    #      accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => :new_record?
    #    end
    #
    #    class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #      has_many :posts
    #      accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => :reject_posts
    #
    #      def reject_posts(attributed)
    #        attributed['title'].blank?
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    # If the hash contains an <tt>id</tt> key that matches an already
    # associated record, the matching record will be modified:
    #
    #   member.attributes = {
    #     :name => 'Joe',
    #     :posts_attributes => [
    #       { :id => 1, :title => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { :id => 2, :title => '[UPDATED] other post' }
    #     ]
    #   }
    #
    #   member.posts.first.title # => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => '[UPDATED] other post'
    #
    # By default the associated records are protected from being destroyed. If
    # you want to destroy any of the associated records through the attributes
    # hash, you have to enable it first using the <tt>:allow_destroy</tt>
    # option. This will allow you to also use the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to
    # destroy existing records:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :allow_destroy => true
    #   end
    #
    #   params = { :member => {
    #     :posts_attributes => [{ :id => '2', :_destroy => '1' }]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member.attributes = params['member']
    #   member.posts.detect { |p| p.id == 2 }.marked_for_destruction? # => true
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.save
    #   member.reload.posts.length # => 1
    #
    # === Saving
    #
    # All changes to models, including the destruction of those marked for
    # destruction, are saved and destroyed automatically and atomically when
    # the parent model is saved. This happens inside the transaction initiated
    # by the parents save method. See ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation.

      #
      # Supported options:
      # [:allow_destroy]

      #   <tt>_destroy</tt> key and a value that evaluates to +true+
      #   (eg. 1, '1', true, or 'true'). This option is off by default.
      # [:reject_if]
      #   Allows you to specify a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method
      #   that checks whether a record should be built for a certain attribute
      #   hash. The hash is passed to the supplied Proc or the method
      #   and it should return either +true+ or +false+. When no :reject_if
      #   is specified, a record will be built for all attribute hashes that
      #   do not have a <tt>_destroy</tt> value that evaluates to true.
      #   Passing <tt>:all_blank</tt> instead of a Proc will create a proc
      #   that will reject a record where all the attributes are blank.
      # [:limit]
      #   Allows you to specify the maximum number of the associated records that
      #   can be processed with the nested attributes. If the size of the
      #   nested attributes array exceeds the specified limit, NestedAttributes::TooManyRecords
      #   exception is raised. If omitted, any number associations can be processed.
      #   Note that the :limit option is only applicable to one-to-many associations.
      # [:update_only]
      #   Allows you to specify that an existing record may only be updated.
      #   A new record may only be created when there is no existing record.
      #   This option only works for one-to-one associations and is ignored for
