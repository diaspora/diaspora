    # Count operates using three different approaches.
    #
    # * Count all: By not passing any parameters to count, it will return a count of all the rows for the model.
    # * Count using column: By passing a column name to count, it will return a count of all the
    #   rows for the model with supplied column present.
    # * Count using options will find the row count matched by the options used.
    #
    # The third approach, count using options, accepts an option hash as the only parameter. The options are:
    #
    # * <tt>:conditions</tt>: An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1" or [ "user_name = ?", username ].
    #   See conditions in the intro to ActiveRecord::Base.
    # * <tt>:joins</tt>: Either an SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id" 
    #   (rarely needed) or named associations in the same form used for the <tt>:include</tt> option, which will
    #   perform an INNER JOIN on the associated table(s). If the value is a string, then the records 
    #   will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the table's columns.
    #   Pass <tt>:readonly => false</tt> to override.
    # * <tt>:include</tt>: Named associations that should be loaded alongside using LEFT OUTER JOINs.
    #   The symbols named refer to already defined associations. When using named associations, count
    #   returns the number of DISTINCT items for the model you're counting.
    #   See eager loading under Associations.
    # * <tt>:order</tt>: An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name" (really only used with GROUP BY calculations).
    # * <tt>:group</tt>: An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the GROUP BY SQL-clause.
    # * <tt>:select</tt>: By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be changed if you, for example,
    #   want to do a join but not include the joined columns.
    # * <tt>:distinct</tt>: Set this to true to make this a distinct calculation, such as
    #   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.id) ...
    # * <tt>:from</tt> - By default, this is the table name of the class, but can be changed to an
    #   alternate table name (or even the name of a database view).
    #
    # Examples for counting all:
    #   Person.count         # returns the total count of all people
    #
    # Examples for counting by column:
    #   Person.count(:age)  # returns the total count of all people whose age is present in database
    #
    # Examples for count with options:
    #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26")
    #
    #   # because of the named association, it finds the DISTINCT count using LEFT OUTER JOIN.
    #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26 AND job.salary > 60000", :include => :job)
    #
    #   # finds the number of rows matching the conditions and joins.
    #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26 AND job.salary > 60000",
    #                :joins => "LEFT JOIN jobs on jobs.person_id = person.id")
    #
    #   Person.count('id', :conditions => "age > 26") # Performs a COUNT(id)
    #   Person.count(:all, :conditions => "age > 26") # Performs a COUNT(*) (:all is an alias for '*')
    #
    # Note: <tt>Person.count(:all)</tt> will not work because it will use <tt>:all</tt> as the condition.
    # Use Person.count instead.

    # +calculate+ for examples with options.

    def minimum(column_name, options = {})
      calculate(:minimum, column_name, options)

    # Calculates the maximum value on a given column. The value is returned

    def maximum(column_name, options = {})
      calculate(:maximum, column_name, options)

    # Calculates the sum of values on a given column. The value is returned
    # with the same data type of the column, 0 if there's no row. See
    # +calculate+ for examples with options.

    def sum(column_name, options = {})
      calculate(:sum, column_name, options)
    end

    # This calculates aggregate values in the given column.  Methods for count, sum, average,
    # minimum, and maximum have been added as shortcuts. Options such as <tt>:conditions</tt>,
    # <tt>:order</tt>, <tt>:group</tt>, <tt>:having</tt>, and <tt>:joins</tt> can be passed to customize the query.
    #
    # There are two basic forms of output:
    #   * Single aggregate value: The single value is type cast to Fixnum for COUNT, Float
    #     for AVG, and the given column's type for everything else.
    #   * Grouped values: This returns an ordered hash of the values and groups them by the
    #     <tt>:group</tt> option.  It takes either a column name, or the name of a belongs_to association.
    #
    #       values = Person.maximum(:age, :group => 'last_name')
    #       puts values["Drake"]
    #       => 43
    #
    #       drake  = Family.find_by_last_name('Drake')
    #       values = Person.maximum(:age, :group => :family) # Person belongs_to :family
    #       puts values[drake]
    #       => 43
    #
    #       values.each do |family, max_age|
    #       ...
    #       end
    #
    # Options:
    # * <tt>:conditions</tt> - An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1" or [ "user_name = ?", username ].
    #   See conditions in the intro to ActiveRecord::Base.
    # * <tt>:include</tt>: Eager loading, see Associations for details.  Since calculations don't load anything,
    #   the purpose of this is to access fields on joined tables in your conditions, order, or group clauses.
    # * <tt>:joins</tt> - An SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id".
    #   (Rarely needed).
    #   The records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the
    #   table's columns.
    # * <tt>:order</tt> - An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name" (really only used with GROUP BY calculations).

    # * <tt>:select</tt> - By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be changed if you for example
    #   want to do a join, but not include the joined columns.
    # * <tt>:distinct</tt> - Set this to true to make this a distinct calculation, such as
    #   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.id) ...
    #
    # Examples:
    #   Person.calculate(:count, :all) # The same as Person.count
    #   Person.average(:age) # SELECT AVG(age) FROM people...
    #   Person.minimum(:age, :conditions => ['last_name != ?', 'Drake']) # Selects the minimum age for
    #                                                                    # everyone with a last name other than 'Drake'
    #
    #   # Selects the minimum age for any family without any minors
    #   Person.minimum(:age, :having => 'min(age) > 17', :group => :last_name)
