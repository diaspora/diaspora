  # One thing that has always been a pain with remote web services is testing.  The HttpMock
  # class makes it easy to test your Active Resource models by creating a set of mock responses to specific
  # requests.
  #
  # To test your Active Resource model, you simply call the ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to
  # method with an attached block.  The block declares a set of URIs with expected input, and the output
  # each request should return.  The passed in block has any number of entries in the following generalized
  # format:
  #
  #   mock.http_method(path, request_headers = {}, body = nil, status = 200, response_headers = {})
  #
  # * <tt>http_method</tt> - The HTTP method to listen for.  This can be +get+, +post+, +put+, +delete+ or
  #   +head+.
  # * <tt>path</tt> - A string, starting with a "/", defining the URI that is expected to be
  #   called.
  # * <tt>request_headers</tt> - Headers that are expected along with the request.  This argument uses a
  #   hash format, such as <tt>{ "Content-Type" => "application/xml" }</tt>.  This mock will only trigger
  #   if your tests sends a request with identical headers.
  # * <tt>body</tt> - The data to be returned.  This should be a string of Active Resource parseable content,
  #   such as XML.
  # * <tt>status</tt> - The HTTP response code, as an integer, to return with the response.
  # * <tt>response_headers</tt> - Headers to be returned with the response.  Uses the same hash format as
  #   <tt>request_headers</tt> listed above.
  #
  # In order for a mock to deliver its content, the incoming request must match by the <tt>http_method</tt>,
  # +path+ and <tt>request_headers</tt>.  If no match is found an InvalidRequestError exception
  # will be raised letting you know you need to create a new mock for that request.
  #
  # ==== Example
  #   def setup
  #     @matz  = { :id => 1, :name => "Matz" }.to_xml(:root => "person")
  #     ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to do |mock|
  #       mock.post   "/people.xml",   {}, @matz, 201, "Location" => "/people/1.xml"
  #       mock.get    "/people/1.xml", {}, @matz
  #       mock.put    "/people/1.xml", {}, nil, 204
  #       mock.delete "/people/1.xml", {}, nil, 200
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   def test_get_matz
  #     person = Person.find(1)
  #     assert_equal "Matz", person.name
