  # The Inflector transforms words from singular to plural, class names to table names, modularized class names to ones without,
  # and class names to foreign keys. The default inflections for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable words are kept
  # in inflections.rb.
  #
  # The Rails core team has stated patches for the inflections library will not be accepted
  # in order to avoid breaking legacy applications which may be relying on errant inflections.
  # If you discover an incorrect inflection and require it for your application, you'll need
  # to correct it yourself (explained below).

    # By default, +camelize+ converts strings to UpperCamelCase. If the argument to +camelize+
    # is set to <tt>:lower</tt> then +camelize+ produces lowerCamelCase.
    #
    # +camelize+ will also convert '/' to '::' which is useful for converting paths to namespaces.
    #
    # Examples:
    #   "active_record".camelize                # => "ActiveRecord"
    #   "active_record".camelize(:lower)        # => "activeRecord"

    #   "active_record/errors".camelize(:lower) # => "activeRecord::Errors"

    # As a rule of thumb you can think of +camelize+ as the inverse of +underscore+,

    #   "SSLError".underscore.camelize # => "SslError"
