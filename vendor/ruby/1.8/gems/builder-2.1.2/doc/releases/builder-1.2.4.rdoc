= Builder 1.2.4 Released.

Added a "CDATA" method to the XML Markup builder (from Josh Knowles).

== What is Builder?

Builder::XmlMarkup allows easy programmatic creation of XML markup.
For example:

  builder = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(:target=>STDOUT, :indent=>2)
  builder.person { |b| b.name("Jim"); b.phone("555-1234") }
  puts builder.target!

will generate:

  <person>
    <name>Jim</name>
    <phone>555-1234</phone>
  </person>

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install builder is via RubyGems ...

  gem install builder    (you may need root/admin privileges)

== Thanks

* Josh Knowles for the cdata! patch.
