= Builder 2.0.0 Released.

== Changes in 2.0.0

* UTF-8 characters in data are now correctly translated to their XML
  equivalents. (Thanks to Sam Ruby)

* Attribute values are now escaped by default.  See the README
  file for details.

<b>NOTE:</b> The escaping attribute values by default is different
than in previous releases of Builder.  This makes version 2.0.0
somewhat incompatible with the 1.x series of Builder.  If you use "&",
"<", or ">" in attributes values, you may have to change your
code. (Essentially you remove the manual escaping.  The new way is
easier, believe me).

== What is Builder?

Builder::XmlMarkup is a library that allows easy programmatic creation
of XML markup.  For example:

  builder = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(:target=>STDOUT, :indent=>2)
  builder.person { |b| b.name("Jim"); b.phone("555-1234") }

will generate:

  <person>
    <name>Jim</name>
    <phone>555-1234</phone>
  </person>

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install builder is via RubyGems ...

  gem install builder    (you may need root/admin privileges)

== Thanks

* Sam Ruby for the XChar module and the related UTF-8 translation
  tools.
* Also to Sam Ruby for gently persuading me to start quoting attribute
  values.
