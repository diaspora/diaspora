* Added a cleanup task to remove unused releases from the deployment directory

* Allow password to be reentered on sudo if it was entered incorrectly

* Use && as the command separator for the checkouts, so that errors are caught early.

* Ping each SSH connection every 1s during command processing so that long-running commands don't cause the connection to timeout.
