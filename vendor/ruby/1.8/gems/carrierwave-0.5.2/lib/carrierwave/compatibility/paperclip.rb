    # Mix this module into an Uploader to make it mimic Paperclip's storage paths
    # This will make your Uploader use the same default storage path as paperclip
    # does. If you need to override it, you can override the +paperclip_path+ method
    # and provide a Paperclip style path:
    #
    #     class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    #       include CarrierWave::Compatibility::Paperclip
    #
    #       def paperclip_path
    #         ":rails_root/public/uploads/:id/:attachment/:style_:basename.:extension"
    #       end
    #     end
