module CarrierWave

  ##
  # If a Class is extended with this module, it gains the mount_uploader
  # method, which is used for mapping attributes to uploaders and allowing
  # easy assignment.
  #
  # You can use mount_uploader with pretty much any class, however it is
  # intended to be used with some kind of persistent storage, like an ORM.
  # If you want to persist the uploaded files in a particular Class, it
  # needs to implement a `read_uploader` and a `write_uploader` method.
  #
  module Mount

    ##
    # === Returns
    #
    # [Hash{Symbol => CarrierWave}] what uploaders are mounted on which columns
    #
    def uploaders
      @uploaders ||= {}
      @uploaders = superclass.uploaders.merge(@uploaders)
    rescue NoMethodError
      @uploaders
    end

    def uploader_options
      @uploader_options ||= {}
      @uploader_options = superclass.uploader_options.merge(@uploader_options)
    rescue NoMethodError
      @uploader_options
    end

    ##
    # Return a particular option for a particular uploader
    #
    # === Parameters
    #
    # [column (Symbol)] The column the uploader is mounted at
    # [option (Symbol)] The option, e.g. validate_integrity
    #
    # === Returns
    #
    # [Object] The option value
    #
    def uploader_option(column, option)
      if uploader_options[column].has_key?(option)
        uploader_options[column][option]
      else
        uploaders[column].send(option)
      end
    end

    ##
    # Mounts the given uploader on the given column. This means that assigning
    # and reading from the column will upload and retrieve files. Supposing
    # that a User class has an uploader mounted on image, you can assign and
    # retrieve files like this:
    #
    #     @user.image # => <Uploader>
    #     @user.image.store!(some_file_object)
    #
    #     @user.image.url # => '/some_url.png'
    #
    # It is also possible (but not recommended) to ommit the uploader, which
    # will create an anonymous uploader class. Passing a block to this method
    # makes it possible to customize it. This can be convenient for brevity,
    # but if there is any significatnt logic in the uploader, you should do
    # the right thing and have it in its own file.
    #
    # === Added instance methods
    #
    # Supposing a class has used +mount_uploader+ to mount an uploader on a column
    # named +image+, in that case the following methods will be added to the class:
    #
    # [image]                   Returns an instance of the uploader only if anything has been uploaded
    # [image=]                  Caches the given file
    #
    # [image_url]               Returns the url to the uploaded file
    #
    # [image_cache]             Returns a string that identifies the cache location of the file
    # [image_cache=]            Retrieves the file from the cache based on the given cache name
    #
    # [remote_image_url]        Returns previously cached remote url
    # [remote_image_url=]       Retrieve the file from the remote url
    #
    # [remove_image]            An attribute reader that can be used with a checkbox to mark a file for removal
    # [remove_image=]           An attribute writer that can be used with a checkbox to mark a file for removal
    # [remove_image?]           Whether the file should be removed when store_image! is called.
    #
    # [store_image!]            Stores a file that has been assigned with +image=+
    # [remove_image!]           Removes the uploaded file from the filesystem.
    #
    # [image_integrity_error]   Returns an error object if the last file to be assigned caused an integrity error
    # [image_processing_error]  Returns an error object if the last file to be assigned caused a processing error
    #
    # [write_image_identifier]  Uses the write_uploader method to set the identifier.
    #
    # === Parameters
    #
    # [column (Symbol)]                   the attribute to mount this uploader on
    # [uploader (CarrierWave::Uploader)]  the uploader class to mount
    # [options (Hash{Symbol => Object})]  a set of options
    # [&block (Proc)]                     customize anonymous uploaders
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # [:mount_on => Symbol] if the name of the column to be serialized to differs you can override it using this option
    # [:ignore_integrity_errors => Boolean] if set to true, integrity errors will result in caching failing silently
    # [:ignore_processing_errors => Boolean] if set to true, processing errors will result in caching failing silently
    #
    # === Examples
    #
    # Mounting uploaders on different columns.
    #
    #     class Song
    #       mount_uploader :lyrics, LyricsUploader
    #       mount_uploader :alternative_lyrics, LyricsUploader
    #       mount_uploader :file, SongUploader
    #     end
    #
    # This will add an anonymous uploader with only the default settings:
    #
    #     class Data
    #       mount_uploader :csv
    #     end
    #
    # this will add an anonymous uploader overriding the store_dir:
    #
    #     class Product
    #       mount_uploader :blueprint do
    #         def store_dir
    #           'blueprints'
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
