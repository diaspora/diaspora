  module Uploader

    ##
    # An uploader is a class that allows you to easily handle the caching and storage of
    # uploaded files. Please refer to the README for configuration options.
    #
    # Once you have an uploader you can use it in isolation:
    #
    #     my_uploader = MyUploader.new
    #     my_uploader.cache!(File.open(path_to_file))
    #     my_uploader.retrieve_from_store!('monkey.png')
    #
    # Alternatively, you can mount it on an ORM or other persistence layer, with
    # +CarrierWave::Mount#mount_uploader+. There are extensions for activerecord and datamapper
    # these are *very* simple (they are only a dozen lines of code), so adding your own should
    # be trivial.
