      # Override this in your Uploader to change the filename.
      #
      # Be careful using record ids as filenames. If the filename is stored in the database
      # the record id will be nil when the filename is set. Don't use record ids unless you
      # understand this limitation.
      #
      # Do not use the version_name in the filename, as it will prevent versions from being
      # loaded correctly.
