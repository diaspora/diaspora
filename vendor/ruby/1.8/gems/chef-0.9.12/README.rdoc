= Chef

== DESCRIPTION:

Chef is a configuration management tool designed to bring automation to your entire infrastructure. 

The Chef Wiki is the definitive source of user documentation. 

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home

This README focuses on developers who want to modify Chef source code. For users who just want to run the latest and greatest Chef development version in their environment, see:

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+from+HEAD

== DEVELOPMENT:

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the Opscode Contributing document.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/opscode/Contributing

You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the Chef Wiki.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/opscode/Working+with+Git

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do use BDD/TDD with RSpec and Cucumber, so you'll need to get a development environment running.

== ENVIRONMENT:

In order to have a development environment where changes to the Chef code can be tested, we'll need to install a few things after setting up the Git repository.

=== Non-Gem Dependencies

Install these via your platform's preferred method; for example apt, yum, ports, emerge, etc.

* Git[http://git-scm.com/]
* Erlang/OTP[http://www.erlang.org/]
* CouchDB[http://couchdb.apache.org/]
* RabbitMQ[http://www.rabbitmq.com/]
* GCC and C Standard Libraries, header files, etc. (i.e., build-essential on debian/ubuntu)
* Ruby development package
* libxml2 development package

=== Runtime Rubygem Dependencies
==== Chef Client and Solo
* ohai
* bunny
* erubis
* extlib
* highline
* json (1.4.4 - 1.4.6)
* mixlib-authentication
* mixlib-cli
* mixlib-config
* mixlib-log
* moneta
* rest-client
* uuidtools
* merb-core

==== Chef Server, WebUI and Solr
All of the above, plus the following:
* coderay
* haml
* libxml-ruby
* merb-assets
* merb-core
* merb-haml
* merb-helpers
* merb-param-protection
* ruby-openid
* thin

=== Development Rubygem Dependencies
* rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org/]
* rspec[http://rspec.info/]
* cucumber[http://cukes.info/]

Ohai is also by Opscode and available on GitHub, http://github.com/opscode/ohai/tree/master.

== Starting the Environment:

=== On Mac OS X:
For ease of debugging, Chef includes a script to start each of the required
daemons in a separate Terminal.app tab via applescript:

  scripts/mac-dev-start features

=== On Linux and BSD

run the dev:features rake task. You may need to run it as root depending on how
your system is configured.

  rake dev:features

=== Daemons
After starting the environment, you should have the following processes running:
* couchdb             listening on port 5984
* rabbitmq            listening on port 5672
* solr                listening on port 8983
* chef-solr-indexer   connected as a client to rabbitmq
* chef-server         listening on port 4000
* chef-server-webui   listening on port 4040

You'll know its running when you see:

    merb : chef-server (api) : worker (port 4000) ~ Starting Thin at port 4000
    merb : chef-server (api) : worker (port 4000) ~ Using Thin adapter on host 0.0.0.0 and port 4000.
    merb : chef-server (api) : worker (port 4000) ~ Successfully bound to port 4000

You'll want to leave this terminal running the dev environment.

=== Web Interface:

With the dev environment running, you can now access the web interface via http://localhost:4040/.

== Spec testing:

We use RSpec for unit/spec tests. It is not necessary to start the development
environment to run the specs--they are completely standalone.

  rake spec

== Integration testing:

We test integration with Cucumber. To run the full suite, run the rake task:

  rake features

Subsets of the integration tests can be run with the various tasks in the
features namespace. To see the full list, run

  rake -T

To run individual feature tests, you can take advantage of cucumber's tagging
support. Tag the feature you wish to run (tags are denoted with a leading `@'
sign), then use the cucumber command:

  cucumber -t @my_tag
