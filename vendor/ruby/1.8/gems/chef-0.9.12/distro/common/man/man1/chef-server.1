.SH DESCRIPTION
The Chef Server is a Merb application slice. Both chef-server and chef-server-slice packages should be installed. This man page was generated for merb and generated for chef-server.
The default listen port is 4000. At a minimum, chef-server should be started with \-c2 so one process starts for the webui (4000) and one process starts for openid (4001).
