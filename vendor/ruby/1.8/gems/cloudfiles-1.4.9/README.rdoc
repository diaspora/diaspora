= Rackspace Cloud Files

== Description

This is a Ruby interface into the Rackspace[http://rackspace.com/] {Cloud Files}[http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files] service. Cloud Files is reliable, scalable and affordable web-based storage hosting for backing up and archiving all your static content.  Cloud Files is the first and only cloud service that leverages a tier one CDN provider to create such an easy and complete storage-to-delivery solution for media content.

== Upgrade Gotchas

As of gem version 1.4.8, the connection method has changed from positional arguments to a hash of options.  This is the new style:

   cf = CloudFiles::Connection.new(:username => "MY_USERNAME", :api_key => "MY_API_KEY")
   
This is the old style, which still works but is deprecated:

   cf = CloudFiles::Connection.new("MY_USERNAME","MY_API_KEY")

== Installation

This source is available on Github[http://github.com/rackspace/ruby-cloudfiles/] and the gem is available on Gemcutter[http://gemcutter.org/].  To install it, do

  gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org/
  
  sudo gem install cloudfiles
  
To use it in a Rails application, add the following information to your config/environment.rb

  config.gem "cloudfiles"
