= Columnize - Module to show an Array formatted as a String aligned in columns. 

== Summary

In showing a long lists, sometimes one would prefer to see the value
arranged aligned in columns. Some examples include listing methods of
an object, listing debugger commands, or showing a numeric array with data
aligned.

=== Setup

  $ irb
  >> a = (1..10).to_a
  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  >> require 'columnize'
  => true
  >> include Columnize
  => Object
  >> g = %w(bibrons golden madascar leopard mourning suras tokay)
  => ["bibrons", "golden", "madascar", "leopard", "mourning", "suras", "tokay"]

=== With numeric data

  columnize(a) 
  => "1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n"
  >> puts Columnize::columnize(a, :arrange_array => true, :displaywidth => 10)
  [1,  2
   3,  4
   5,  6
   7,  8
   9, 10
  ]
  => nil
  >> puts Columnize::columnize(a, :arrange_array => true, :displaywidth => 20)
  [1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6
   7, 8, 9, 10
  ]

=== With String data

  >> puts columnize g, :displaywidth => 15
  bibrons   suras
  golden    tokay
  madascar
  leopard 
  mourning
  => nil

  >> puts columnize g, {:displaywidth => 18, :colsep => ' | '}
  bibrons  | suras
  golden   | tokay
  madascar
  leopard 
  mourning
  => nil

  >> puts columnize g, {:displaywidth => 18, :colsep => ' | ', :ljust=>false}

    golden | tokay
  madascar
   leopard
