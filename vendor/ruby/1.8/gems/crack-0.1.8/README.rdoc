= crack

Really simple JSON and XML parsing, ripped from Merb and Rails. The XML parser is ripped from Merb and the JSON parser is ripped from Rails. I take no credit, just packaged them for all to enjoy and easily use.

== note on releases

Releases are tagged on github and also released as gems on github and rubyforge. Master is pushed to whenever I add a patch or a new feature. To build from master, you can clone the code, generate the updated gemspec, build the gem and install.

* rake gemspec
* gem build httparty.gemspec
* gem install the gem that was built

== note on patches/pull requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== usage
  
  gem 'crack'
  require 'crack' # for xml and json
  require 'crack/json' # for just json
  require 'crack/xml' # for just xml

== examples
  
  Crack::XML.parse("<tag>This is the contents</tag>")
    # => {'tag' => 'This is the contents'}
  
  Crack::JSON.parse('{"tag":"This is the contents"}')
    # => {'tag' => 'This is the contents'}
