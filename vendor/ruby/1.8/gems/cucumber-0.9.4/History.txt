  This makes it more practical in most cases to mix tags from profiles and the command line

  In previous versions the following command line:

    --tags @foo,~@bar --tags @zap (on the command line)

  or the following Hook:

    Before("@foo,~@bar", "@zap") (for Hooks)

== 0.4.0 2009-10-09

The back to stable release. When we went from 0.3.11 to 0.3.90 we thought we were close to a 0.4.0 release. Then the community
went nuts and a lot of great contributions came in. Some of those broke backwards compatibility, and we decided it would be
better to do this while still on 0.3.x.

Rails users: you *must* run script/generate cucumber after installing this version.

This release gives you back some of the control over the Rails environment that was accidentally taken away from you in the
previous release.

Using this release on a Rails project requires a rerun of script/generate cucumber.

== 0.3.102 2009-09-22

This release has some changes in the Rails support, so make sure you run "script/generate cucumber" after you upgrade.
Other noteworthy new features are improved Hook, tags and Transform support, and as always - several smaller bug fixes.

=== New Features
* Added new internal API for Regexp and groups, allowing other programming languages to leverage native regexps. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New @allow_rescue tag for Rails scenarios. Causes exceptions raised in actions to be caught by rails and not bubble up to Cucumber (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Negative tags can now be used in hooks, just like the command line's --tags option: Before('~@yarr') - will run for all scenarios that *don't* have the @yarr tag. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Transform has current "World" scope (Larry Diehl)
* Other Transforms can be reused by calling Transform with a string inside of another Transform definition (Larry Diehl)
* Execute "After" hooks in reverse order of declaration for better behavior with dependent blocks and to mimic the behavior of at_exit (David Waite)

=== Removed features
* The Cucumber::Rails.bypass_rescue no longer exists. Errors will always bubble up, unless you use the new @allow_rescue tag. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Cucumber::Rails.use_transactional_fixtures no longer exists. Transactional fixtures are always enabled for the cucumber environment. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.101 2009-09-15

Two exciting things in this release. Step Argument Transforms and a PDF formatter you can use to send
your features to your customer for review!

=== New Features
* New pdf formatter (#425 Mads Buus)
* Step Argument Transforms: These let you use the Transform method to register regular expressions
  to catch and transform/coerce arguments before they are yielded to step definitions:
  http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/step-argument-transforms (Larry Diehl & Dave Astels)
* Adding webrat steps for asserting content does or does not exist within a particular element
  (using webrat's within method)  (Kieran Pilkington)

in 2 days.

=== New Features
* Backtrace filtering now happens in StepInvocation class, meaning other languages (Cuke4Duke) can get backtraces stripped. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber::Ast::Table#map_headers now allows for a block that will convert all the headers. See docs for details. (Ben Mabey)

== 0.3.97 2009-08-23

The AA-FTT release. Creating a release for the AA-FTT meeting in Chicago so that we can play
with the new language API and maybe knock out some better .NET support.

=== Bugfixes
* Allow comments on examples sections underneath scenario outlines (#420 Mike Sassak)
* Table.map_headers! will fail with a decent error message when 0 or 2+ headers are matched. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed an issue with comments with preceding spaces after a background causing a parse error (#401 Joseph Wilk)

* The Programming Language API manages hooks on the language level instead of on the step mother level (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.96 2009-08-15

This release doesn't have any significant new features or bug fixes, but there are big
internal changes. This release has a new API for plugging in other programming languages.
You can read more about that here: http://groups.google.com/group/cukes/browse_thread/thread/b9db8bf1f3ec9708

This might break other tools that are using Cucumber's internal APIs. For example Spork broke and had to
be patched. Please upgrade to Spork 0.5.9 if you are using Spork.

=== New Features
* Ability to preload natural language in Spork's prefork. Rerun script/generate cucumber --spork to see how. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Ability to control which DRb port is used via the --port flag or by setting CUCUMBER_DRB environment variable. (Chris Flipse)
* Upgrade Rails generator to use webrat 0.5.0. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Upgrade Sinatra example to work with rack-test 0.4.1 and webrat 0.5.0. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed Features
* --strict will cause an exit code 1 for missing and pending (used to be for missing only). (Mads Buus)
* junit formatter doesn't report pending steps unless --strict is used. (Mads Buus)

== 0.3.95 2009-08-13

This release improves Webrat support for table-like HTML markup. Now you can easily turn the HTML
elements table, dl, ol and ul elements into a 2D array. This is particularly useful for comparing
data in your HTML with a Cucumber table using Cucumber::Ast::Table#diff!

This release also fixes several bugs related to --drb (Spork) and profiles (cucumber.yml)

=== Bug Fixes
* --guess will always prefer the longest regexp with no groups if they exist.
* Prevent delays if a NoMethodError is raise in a step definition. Define a light #inspect in World. (#374 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Restore 'features' as the default feature running path. (#412 Ben Mabey)
* --drb degrades gracefully when no drb server is running and no formatter is provided. (#410 Ben Mabey)
* --language picked up from profiles again. (#409 Ben Mabey)
* Resolved infinite loop problem when --drb was defined in a profile. (#408 Ben Mabey)

=== New Features
* Cucumber::World#table has been overloaded to work with 2D Array in addition to a table String to be parsed.
* New When /^I fill in the following:$/ step definition for Webrat. Useful for filling out a form with a Table. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The object returned by element_at (Webrat::Element) has a #to_table that works for table, dl, ol and ul. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* An explanation of why failures are ok is printed when --wip is used. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added cucumber alias for cucumber:ok in Rails Rake tasks. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed features
* element_at('table').to_table should be used instead of table_at('table').to_a. The old way is deprecated but still works. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* element_at (and the depracated table_at) no longer takes a DOM id, only CSS selectors. Change "my_id" to "#my_id". (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.94 2009-08-06

Kanban take II.

Release 0.3.6 introduced a new --wip switch that can be used to limit work in progress
(WIP). Limiting WIP is central for Kanban Software Development (http://www.infoq.com/articles/hiranabe-lean-agile-kanban).

However, this feature went mostly unnoticed, and because we think it's so great we have decided
to make it the default for Rails projects. When you bootstrap your Rails project for Cucumber
you will now get 2 Cucumber Rake tasks for Kanban development:

  cucumber:ok  : Run features that should pass. This runs your "good,old" features
  cucumber:wip : Run the features you're working on that don't pass yet. Tag them with @wip. Max 2!

So upgrade today and get into the habit of tagging new features with @wip (or invent your own tags).
You'll achieve better flow this way.

=== New features
* Support limiting the number of feature elements with certain tags (#353 Joseph Wilk)
* script/generate cucumber sets up 'cucumber:ok' and 'cucumber:wip' tasks and deprecates 'features'. More Kanban love. (#344 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Better JUnit formatter: feature->testsuite, scenario->testcase. Better timing and support for background and scenario outline. (Mads Buus Westmark)
* Added examples/python that uses rubypython. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Checks the number of available colors on the terminal with ruby-terminfo if ruby-terminfo is installed.
  This prevents Apple's Terminal.app from stalling (Yugui - Yuki Sonoda).
  * Set 'xterm-256color' to TERM if your terminal supports grey.
  * ruby-terminfo is available as genki-ruby-terminfo gem from github.
* Document builtin formatters with --help. (#406 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added support for using regular expressions when mapping table headers.  (Peter Williams)

== 0.3.93 2009-08-03

Highlights in this release: Improved profile handling (cucumber.yml) and a fix for cucumber hanging.

=== New features
* script/generate cucumber --spork now sets up a spork gem dependency in the cucumber.rb environment. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Feature files defined on the command line override any that are present in profiles. (#344 Ben Mabey)
* Default (STDOUT) formatter defined in profile can be overridden from the command line. (#344 Ben Mabey)
* Displays which profile, if any, is being used. (Ben Mabey)
* click_link_within(parent, link) webrat step (Joakim Kolsjö)

=== Bugfixes
* script/cucumber correctly loads the gem's binary if the plugin isn't installed.
* Cucumber hangs waiting for Ctrl+C if an Error is raised. (#374 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.92 2009-07-29

This release has some minor improvements to the new Table.diff! functionality. For example,
if you're using Webrat and you want to compare a feature table with a HTML table containing
links in one of the columns, you can do:

  actual = Cucumber::Ast::Table.new(table_at('table').to_a)
  actual.map_column!('Name') { |text| text.strip.match(/>(.*)</)[1] }
  table.diff!(actual)

=== New features
* Allow Step Definitions to accept mix of required & optional args (Niels Ganser)
* table_a.diff!(table_b) now uses column conversions from both tables (Table#map_column!) (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* Upgrade Sinatra example to work with rack-test 0.3.0 and aslakhellesoy-webrat 0.4.4.1 (Aslak Hellesøy)
* require 'cucumber/webrat/table_locator' added to Spork environment for Rails (Anders Furseth)

=== Changed Features
* The 'default' profile is now ALWAYS used unless you specify another profile or use the -P or --no-profile flag. (#344 Ben Mabey)

== 0.3.91 2009-07-27

=== New Features
* CTRL-C will exit immediately instead of carrying on until all features are run. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Run can be stopped programmatically by setting $cucumber_interrupted = true, for example in an After block. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Support limiting the number of feature elements with certain tags (#353 Joseph Wilk)
* Table support for cuke4duke

== 0.3.90 2009-07-22

The Hot summer release

This is a hot summer in Norway, and Cucumbers are growing in abundance. To celebrate this we give you
a new release with lots of new features and bugfixes. This is also one of the last releases in the 0.3 series
(hence the 0.3.90 number), so 0.4 (or maybe 1.0!) will be coming up soon. The highlights of this release are:

=== Egality

English is not the world's most spoken language, so why should Cucumber force non-English speakers to use the
--language flag? As of this release you're no longer forced to do that. Instead, you can add a comment header
to your .feature files:

  # language: fr
  # Cucumber understands that this is French
  Fonctionnalité: Trou de boulette

If you don't have that header, Cucumber will work as before - using whatever you specified with --language,
or default to English if no --language option was specified. A nice side effect of this is that you can now
have features in several languages side by side and run them in the same cucumber. (Not recommended unless
you want to take polyglot programming to an extreme level).

=== Table diffing (experimental)

When you pass a table as an argument to your Then steps you often want to compare that table
to some actual values. In previous releases you had to iterate over the table's values and manually
compare each row using cell.should equal('foo') or assert_equal('foo', cell). If a discrepancy was found
you'd get an error, but it was hard to see how the entire expected data set was different from the actual one.

With this release you have a much more powerful way to compare expected tables with actual data. An
Ast::Table object now has a new #diff!(table) method that you can invoke in your step definitions
that take table arguments. If the table you pass in is different from the expected table (from your
plain text step), Cucumber will print the difference for each of the row or column and fail your step.

The Table#diff! method expects an Array of Array, Array of Hash (similar to what you'd get from table#hashes)
or simply another Ast::Table object. Here is a simple example:

  Then /^I should see the following cukes:$/ do |expected_cukes_table|
    actual_table = ... # For example [['Latin', 'English'], ['Cucumis sativus', 'Cucumber'], ['Cucumis anguria', 'Burr Gherkin']]
    expected_cukes_table.diff!(actual_table)
  end

As an extra bonus we provide Webrat users with a new #table_at(selector) method that you can use to transform
an HTML table into an Array of Array, so that you can easily compare the contents of your HTML table to
expected data passed to a step. Here is an example:

  Then /^I should see the following cukes:$/ do |expected_cukes_table|
    expected_cukes_table.diff!(table_at('#cuke_table').to_a)
  end

You can do the same trick to compare data from a Rails ActiveRecord table (although this is not a
recommended practice - your Then steps should compare against what users *see*, not what's in the
database):

  # This requires that you use the column names in the header of the plain text expected table
  Then /^I should have the following cukes in the database:$/ do |expected_cukes_table|
    expected_cukes_table.diff!(Cuke.find(:all).map(&attributes))
  end

=== Environment variables

Another useful new feature is the ability to define environment variables on Cucumber's command line (just
like you can with Rake). Example:

  cucumber FOO=BAR --format progress features

You can now pick up ENV['FOO'] in ruby (for example in env.rb) and take actions according to the value,
for example enabling your super hack that validates all HTTP responses for XHTML validity.

This release also has several bugfixes related to --format and Before/After hooks.

=== Bugfixes
* Fix some misspellings which affect test fail for Korean example (#373 Dongju Kim)
* Make it possible to write non-localized step definitions (#377 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Table cells containing unicode are rendered incorrectly (#386 Stefan Kanev)
* Before and After hooks run after everything is finished when there are 2+ --format options (#371 Aslak Hellesøy)
* When using --out and two --format the first is not delivered inline with execution of features (#361 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Profile Formatter broken (#370 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Default profile usage with --drb flag degrades gracefully with no server. (#367 Ben Mabey)
* JUnit formatter uses original file name instead of narrative to avoid accidental duplicate XML files (Aslak Hellesøy)
* rake gems no longer lists cucumber as a [F]ramework gem (David Chelimsky)
* CLI issues correct exit code when using --drb. Requires Spork version >= 0.5.1. (#355 Ben Mabey)
* Make sure script/generate cucumber --spork uses the cucumber Rails environment (Philippe Lafoucrière)
* Fixed bug with rake task raising errors with feature files with spaces (#380 Joseph Wilk)

=== New Features
* I should see should support regexes (#382 John Ferlito)
* Access to scenario outline name from After hook scenario parameter (#342 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Allow multiple --tags switches to be passed
* Load step definitions from vendored gems and plugins (#388 Mike Burns)
* New --format steps formatter. Variant of the usage formatter that lists available step definitions (Demetrius Nunes)
* Possibility to specify scenario language as part of the .feature file (#345 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Support specifying environment variables using foo=bar syntax on command line or in profiles (#362 Bryan Helmkamp)
* Display failing scenarios at the end of pretty format to make it easier for people to play them back (#360 Ryan Bigg)

=== Changed Features
* When using --tags, positive tags are &&'ed while negative tags are ||'ed (John Wilger)
* The data returned from Table#hashes and similar methods are frozen. Dup if you need to modify. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Visitor.visit_table_cell_value(value, col_width, status) is now visitor.visit_table_cell_value(value, status)

== 0.3.11 2009-06-05

This release just fixes a tiny bug in the formatter to fix an incompatibility
with the latest RedMine release. It should have been included in 0.3.10, but
was forgotten.

=== Bugfixes
* Formatter API was broken in 0.3.9 (Roman Chernyatchik)

== 0.3.10 2009-06-05

The Spork Release!

This release has an exciting new feature - a new --drb switch! This magic switch lets you run your
features much faster than before, because you can eliminate the startup time for your code. This is
thanks to a brand new gem called Spork by Tim Harper and Ben Mabey. (You can find out more about Spork
here: http://github.com/timcharper/spork/tree/master). You can start Spork and have it preload your
application in a separate process. Spork listens for DRb connections, and when you run cucumber with
--drb the features will run inside the Spork server instead. Spork provides two simple hooks for preloading
your application - one for framework/stable code (Spork.prefork) and one for the code that *you* write and
change often (Spork.each_run). Keep in mind that all World, Before, and other Cucumber hooks need to be
in the Spork.each_run block.  Using Spork works great for Ruby on Rails, which can take a while to load,
but --drb and Spork aren't tied to Rails at all. The new --drb switch also works great alongside autotest
(just add --drb to your autotest profile in cucumber.yml), so now you can get even faster feedback.

Cucumber's built-in cucumber generator now has a new --spork switch, so when you bootstrap your Rails
application for cucumber, you can have spork configuration set up out of the box. (It's just a
slightly different env.rb.)

Although Spork was in mind when the --drb switch was added it is important to realize that all that was added
to Cucumber was a DRb client.  Any DRb server that adheres to this protocol can be used with Cucumber's --drb
switch. While Spork is geared towards removing the load time to give you a faster feedback loop you could
just as easily use this client with a server that distributes your features to run in parallel. Someone just
needs to write such a server. ;)

This release also has some minor bugfixes related to RSpec and Rails interop.

=== Bugfixes
* RSpec's be_* matchers did not work in 0.3.9 and probably earlier versions. Now they do. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Rails cucumber environment won't declare gem dependencies if the plugin exists. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Rails cucumber generator will no longer declare gem dependencies on rspec if you use --testunit. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Spork support via --drb. (Ben Mabey)
* Added a Ast::Feature#name method for convenience. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed features
* The HTML formatter wraps examples in a div, and distinguishes between Scenario and Scenario Outline. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.9 2009-05-27

Bugfix release for 0.3.8 released earlier today. 0.3.8 had a bug in the Rails cucumber
generator which is fixed in 0.3.9.

=== Bugfixes
* Fix broken Rails cucumber generator (Tim Glen)
* The Cucumber Rake task in non-fork mode will properly cause Rake to exit with 1 when Cucumber fails. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.8 2009-05-27

This Cucumber version fixes several bugs related to Ruby on Rails and RSpec. If you
use Cucumber with a Rails app we *strongly* recommend you bootstrap Cucumber again:

  ruby script/generate cucumber

=== New Features
* Rails cucumber generator sets up default gem dependencies in cucumber environment.
* The duration of a run is reported by formatters - same format as the Linux time command (#228 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Scenario and ExampleRow objects (passed to Before and After hooks) have #name and #line methods (#316 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Rails generator creates a cucumber environment file to avoid potential cache_classes conflicts in test.rb (#165, Ben Mabey)
* HTML formatter renders @tags (but the CSS is still ugly)

=== Removed/changed features
* The Cucumber Rake task will again fork by default (as 0.3.3 and earlier). Forking must be turned off explicitly. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* Better coexistence with RSpec - Cucumber now *neuters* the part of RSpec that tries to parse ARGV.
* The differ= exception is gone (#325, #340 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.7 2009-05-22

This is the "Help JetBrains RubyMine" release!

=== New Features
* Added new Given alias for Catalan: Donat|Donada (Lleïr Borràs Metje)
* New --expand option. This will print Scenario Outlines once for each Example row - with values expanded. (#327 Aslak Hellesøy)
* You can override the formatter in Rails-generated rake tasks with the CUCUMBER_FORMAT environment variable (#335 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* 'specs' folder needs to be renamed back to 'spec' (#339 Aslak Hellesøy)
* CUCUMBER_OPTS doesn't work for cucumber rake tasks (#336 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.6 2009-05-20

Kanban! With this release you can tag features or scenarios that are work in progress
with a tag and use the new --wip switch.

Another handy feature in this release is that you can package your own formatters in RubyGems.

=== New features
* New --wip switch. See http://www.jroller.com/perryn/entry/bdd_on_a_multi_disciplined (Perryn Fowler)
* Added a AfterStep hook (Luke Melia)
* New aliases for Vietnamese (Ngoc Dao)
* Automatic require of custom formatters. --require is no longer needed to load them, and they can be in Ruby gems. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Lazy loading of built-in formatters. Should improve startup time a little bit.

=== Bugfixes
* Gracefully handle exceptions in After block (#330 Matt Wynne)
* Feature with only Background doesn't run hooks (#314, #329 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.5 2009-05-14

Let's make a new release today because two annoying bugs are fixed.

=== Bugfixes
* Allow feature element names to contain Gherkin keywords as long as they are not the first word on a newline (#319, #307 Joseph Wilk)

== 0.3.4 2009-05-14

A couple of great new features in this release. Running with Rake is faster than before,
and there is a brand new JUnit formatter - great for Continuous Integration reports!

This release was made especially for the Oslo XP Meetup today.

** IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES FOR RAILS USERS **

Running Cucumber features in the same Ruby interpreter as Rake doesn't seem to work,
so you have to explicitly tell the task to fork (like it was doing by default in prior
versions). In lib/tasks/cucumber.rake:

  Cucumber::Rake::Task.new(:features) do |t|
    t.fork = true # Explicitly fork
    t.cucumber_opts = %w{--format pretty}
  end

(If you run script/generate cucumber this will be done for you).
Alternatively you can omit forking and run features like this:

  RAILS_ENV=test rake cucumber

However, setting the RAILS_ENV is easy to forget, so I don't recommend relying on this.

=== Bugfixes
* Hooks (World, Before, After) are no longer executed when --dry-run (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Proper UTF8 use in HTML formatter (Herminio Torres)
* Problem with multiple terms in languages.yml (#321 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* New JUnit formatter (Gareth Jones)
* Support for Vietnamese (Ngoc Dao)
* Added aliases for Feature and But in Japanese (Leonard Chin)
* Support for Catalan (Francesc Esplugas)

=== Changed features
* --exclude flag now works on ruby files in addition to feature files (#312 Ben Mabey)
* The Java example under examples/java uses Ant instead of Rake - and the new JUnit formatter.
* Rake task should not shell out (#297 Aslak Hellesøy)
  The Cucumber Rake task will run Cucumber in the same Ruby interpreter as Rake itself
  unless explicitly told to fork a new interpreter. This is to increase speed. You can
  force a new interpreter by setting fork=true or rcov=true in the task.

== 0.3.3 2009-05-10

Minor bugfix release, made specially for EuRuKo!

=== Bugfixes
* Summaries are no longer printed in an empty () if there are no scenarios/steps (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Background, Scenario Outline, Before Hook interaction (#309 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Multiline String snippets no longer give misleading info. It's a String, not a PyString that's sent to step def.

=== Removed/changed features
* New aliases: --no-source/-s, --name/-n (#317 Lonnon Foster)

== 0.3.2 2009-05-05

This release has some minor bug fixes and new features.
Nothing major, but we need a release for RailsConf'09 in Las Vegas!

=== Bugfixes
* rake tasks with profiles not respecting --require flags (#311 Ben Mabey)
* Step table with blank cell fails (#308 JohnnyT)
* Fixed error where unused table cells in Examples where raising exceptions due to having no status (#302 Joseph Wilk)

=== New features
* Support for Hebrew (Ido Kanner)
* Summary should report scenarios (#32 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Examples and the associated tables are indented one level deeper than Scenario Outline. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added support for Examples selection when using --name. (#295 Joseph Wilk)

== 0.3.1 2009-04-26

This release has several minor bug fixes and new features. With the addition of Latvian and Hungarian Cucumber
now supports 32(!!) languages.

=== New features
* Support multiline names for Scenarios, Scenario Outlines, Backgrounds, Examples (#231 Joseph Wilk)
* Added #headers to Cucumber::Ast::Table (Ben Mabey)
* New translation for Latvian (Vitauts Stočka)
* New translation for Hungarian (#287 Bence Golda)
* Pick up failure on after hook (#272 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* Pretty formatter not colouring Examples tables correctly (#304 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Problem using --scenario and Scenario Outline (#298 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Tag Hook gets executed always there is a background (#301 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Feature which only has a Background with steps causes an exception (#306 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Gem no longer depends on Hoe (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Span html tags appear on HTML results with 0.3.0 (#299 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed incorrect colours in pretty formatter's table headers for outline tables (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Exceptions from steps called within hooks are now reraised. (#294 Ben Mabey)

=== Removed/changed features
* --scenario handle has been removed and replaced with --name which supports partial matches, regexp special characters, running named backgrounds (#295 Joseph Wilk)

== 0.3.0 2009-04-14

This release has some minor changes to the APIs, but big enough that a new major release is in order.
The biggest change is the new semantics of the #World method. Previously you would call this method
several times, passing a Proc and extending the world object of the previous one with a Ruby module.
The problem was that there was no nice way to ensure the order in which these procs were called, which
led to some unexpected situations. In this release you can only register a single World proc. If you
want to extend a world with certain modules, you simply call the #World method with the module(s)
you wish to extend the World with. The Sinatra example illustrates how to do this. Also check out
the RDoc for Cucumber::StepMother#World.

The Visitor API (which is used for formatters) has also changed slightly. However, we have tried to
do this in a backwards compatible way, so if you have custom formatters for Cucumber 0.2 they should
still work.

One of the most significant new features is Tagged Hooks: http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/hooks
This lets you associate Before and After blocks with specific scenarios.

We are also deprecating the step_list, step_pattern, feature_list, and feature_pattern accessors on
Cucumber::Rake::Task. These accessors will be completely removed in version 0.4. For complex settings
please rely on cucumber profiles in your rake tasks:
http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/using-rake#profiles

=== New features
* Use Hooks with @tags (#229 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Rake task supports cucumber.yml profiles (#187 Ben Mabey)
* Field value steps for Webrat (Jack Chen)
* Added translation for Bulgarian (Krasimir Angelov)
* Updated translation for Polish (#273 Grzegorz Marszałek)
* Only a single World proc can be registered. World extension now happens by calling #World with ruby modules.
* Portuguese uses Funcionalidade in stead of Característica and accented words are aliased with unaccented ones (Alexandre da Silva and Felipe Coury).
* The usage formatter also prints unused step definitions (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Better exception if a World proc returns nil. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Allow Step Definitions to use |*varargs|, but only on Ruby 1.9. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Snippets for steps that use Step Tables or PyStrings include block param and object type hint comment (#247 Joseph Wilk)
* Support description string for Backgrounds (#271 Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* After methods not being executed when Background fails (#288 Luismi Cavallé)
* Fixed dependency on internal files in rspec breaks cucumber w/ rspec-1.2.4 (#291 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fix color use when using autotest on Linux. (Hans de Graaff)
* Fixed incorrect calculation of pystring indentation (#279 Eugene Naydanov)
* Fixed --format html leads to an error (#252 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Background runs twice (#255 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Background Transactions and :xx (#270 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Autospec failing with cucumber 0.2 (#254 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Sibling file detecting not working (#278 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed/changed features
* The visitor API has changed slightly:
** #visit_step_name, #visit_multiline_arg and #visit_exception are no longer official API methods.
** #visit_step_result replaces those 3 methods.
** Table and PyString no longer hold status information. Each visitor subclass should store state in @state if needed.
** #visit_py_string no longer takes a status argument.

== 0.2.3 2009-03-30

This release sports 4 updated languages, slightly better help with snippets if you "quote" arguments
in your steps. Windows/JRuby users can enjoy colours and you get some more sugar with Tables.

=== New features
* Added new Then /^I should be on (.+)$/ do |page_name| step (Grant Hollingworth)
* Use skipped_param color for examples table header (#266 Eugene Naydanov)
* Added new Cucumber::Ast::Table#rows_hash method (Torbjørn Vatn)
* Windows/JRuby users can now enjoy colourful output (via http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ansicolor) (#166 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Ambiguous step errors hint about --guess (unless --guess already on) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added translation for Slovak (Ahmed Al Hafoudh)
* Updated translation for Dutch (Bart Zonneveld)

* Backtrace is back in HTML reports (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.2.2 2009-03-25

This release includes some minor changes to make Cucumber work with pure Java. Cucumber
has already worked with Java for a while (using JRuby and step definitions in Ruby),
but now you can write step definitions in pure Java!

Check out the Cucumber Java project for more details:
http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_java/tree/master

== 0.2.1 2009-03-25

This release fixes a few minor bugs and adds a couple of new features.

== Bugfixes
* Fixed Cucumber, and rails controller error handling (#49 Matt Patterson)
* HTML Formatter doesn't work correctly with scenario Outlines. (#260 Aslak Hellesøy)
* After blocks are run in reverse order of registration. (#113 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Snippets are showing 'Ands' (#249 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Snippets use a regexp and block arguments if the step name has "quoted" arguments. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber::Ast::Feature#to_sexp includes the file name. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* support/env.rb is not loaded when --dry-run is specified. This is to increase performance. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New usage formatter. This is the foundation for editor autocompletion and navigation between steps and step definitions. (#209 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features
* -S/--step-definitions option introduced in 0.2.0 is removed. Use --format usage [--dry-run] [--no-color].

== 0.2.0 2009-03-18

This release sports a bunch of new and exciting features, as well a major rewrite of Cucumber's internals.
The rewrite was done to address technical debt and to have a code base that is easier to evolve and maintain.

There are some changes to the Gherkin language that breaks backwards compatible with the 0.1.x series.
Most importantly, "GivenScenario" and "More Examples" no longer exist. See the "Removed features" section
below for more details on how to use alternatives.

Since the grammar has changed, there are some new keywords. We have to rely on the community
to provide updated translations. This is much easier than before - just update languages.yml.
There is no static code generation anymore. To list all languages:

  cucumber --lang help

And to list the keywords for a particular language:

  cucumber --lang en-lol help

There are some really awesome new features in this release: Tagging, Autoformatting, automatic
aliasing of keywords in all languages, full Ruby 1.9 support and improved output
for multiline arguments are some of the highlights.

== (0.1.16.4 aslakhellesoy-cucumber gem on GitHub)

Bugfix release.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR RAILS USERS.
The template used to generate your features/support/env.rb has changed. You have to apply a minor change
manually for existing Rails projects when you upgrade to this version. Change this:

  require 'webrat/rspec-rails'

to this:

  require 'webrat/core/matchers'

=== New features
* Finnish translation (Tero Tilus)
* Use Webrat's #contain matcher in generated "I should (not) see" step definitions (Bryan Helmkamp)

* Flush output in HTML formatter since JRuby doesnt do it automatically (Diego Carrion)
* Better handling of ARGV (#169 David Chelimsky, Ben Mabey)
* Compatibility with ruby-debug (do ARGV.dup in bin/cucumber so it can restart ruby with same args) (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.16 2009-01-19

This is a small bugfix release. The most notable improvement is compatibility with Webrat 0.4. Rails/Webrat users should
upgrade both Cucumber and Webrat gems.

=== New features
* Allow argument placeholders in step tables and multiline comments (#121 Joseph Wilk)
* Scenario Outline can be followed by several named Examples sections (#123 Aslak Hellesøy)

Bugfix release

=== New features
* 한국어! (Korean!) (John Hwang)

=== Bugfixes
* --dry-run skips running before/after/steps (#147 Ian Dees)
* Fix a minor bug in the console formatter's summary (David Chelimsky)
* Better quoting of Scenario names in Autotest (Peter Jaros)
* Added some small workarounds for unicode handling on Windows (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.14 2009-01-04

This is the first release of Cucumber that runs on Ruby 1.9. There are still some encoding-related issues
with Arabic (ar), Japanese (ja) and Simplified Chinese (zh-CN). Patches are welcome. Other than that -
a couple of minor bug fixes and polishing.

=== New features
* Pretty formatter shows number of scenarios (#139 Joseph Wilk)
* Rudimentary support for Ruby 1.9. Now it's ok to file Ruby 1.9-related bugs.

== 0.1.13 2008-12-20

It's time for some new features again. Output is now much better since you can use diffing, tweak
the output colours and get the full --backtrace if you want. Managing your support/* files became
a little easier since they are now always loaded before the step definitions. Life became easier
for Windows users in Norway (and other countries using unicode in the features). Plus several other
bug fixes.

Enjoy!

This is the "getting serious with IronRuby release" - largely based on
"Patrick Gannon":http://www.patrickgannon.net/archive/2008/10/23/bdd-style-feature-tests-using-ironruby-and-rspeccucumber.aspx's
blog entry.

== New features

This release mostly has smaller bugfixes. The most significant new feature is how
line numbers are specified. You can now run multiple features at specific lines numbers like this:

* Raise a nice error when encountering step definition without block (#95 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Features written using Ruby where breaking due to missing a line number (#91 Joseph Wilk)
* Directly creating a Table meant the scenario table header was never set which was causing a formatter error (#91 Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* $KCODE='u' is no longer done automatically. Developers should do that explicitly when needed in step definitions or env.rb.
* Step definition without a block being treated as pending (#64 Joseph Wilk)
* The --line option has been removed. Use the new file.feature:line format instead.

== 0.1.9 2008-11-12

With this release Cucumber supports 19 (!) natural languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese Simplified
* Danish
* Dutch
* Estonian
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Malay
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Texan
* Welsh

Thanks a lot to everyone who has contributed translations. If you don't see your language here, please
add it: http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/spoken-languages

Main functional changes in this release is "Autotest":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/autotest-integration
support and how multiline strings work in feature files:

  # In your .feature file
  Then I should see
    """
    A string
      that "indents"
    and spans
    several lines

    """

  # In your steps.rb file
  Then 'I should see' do |text|
    text.should == "A string\n  that \"indents\"\nand spans\nseveral lines\n"
  end

The triple quotes are used to define the start and end of a string, and it also defines what gets stripped away
in the inside string. If the triple quotes are indented 4 spaces, then the text within will have the 4 first
spaces removed too.

=== New features
* Added --[no-]color option to force color on or off (Peter Jaros)
* Step definition without a block will be treated as pending (#64 Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Welsh (improvements welcome) (Joseph Wilk)
* Added --quiet option to hide all development aid output when using Pretty formatter (#69 Joseph Wilk)
* Added --no-snippets option to hide snippets for pending steps when using Pretty formatter (#69 Joseph Wilk)

* Added new --exclude option (Bryan Helkamp)
* Added new --scenario option (Peter Jaros)
* Renamed common_webrat.rb to webrat_steps.rb (Ben Mabey, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added new feature[:feature_path] task (Roman Gonzalez)
* Added support for Polish (Joseph Wilk)
* Support specifying multiple formatters and multiple outputs (#47 Joseph Wilk)

* Snippets are not shown for steps which already have a step definition (#65 Joseph Wilk)
* Prevent feature/scenario/pending step comments from containing '//' when running features by specifying a directory with a trailing '/' (Joseph Wilk)
* Scenario tables need spacing after them (#59 Joseph Wilk)
* Support running scenario table rows when using --line argument (#55 Joseph Wilk)
* Don't load cucumber.yml unless it exists (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixing bug where specifying line number 1 in a feature which starts with a scenario with a scenario table was raising an error (#56 Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features


== 0.1.8 2008-10-18

This release extends the support for tables. PLEASE NOTE THAT TABLES ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL.
In previous releases it has been possible to use tables to define "more examples" of a scenario in
a FIT-style column fixture kind of way. Now you can also use tables as arguments to steps.

Tables used to define more examples after a scenario must now be prefixed. In English it looks like this:

  Feature: Addition
    In order to avoid silly mistakes
    As a math idiot
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers

    Scenario: Add two numbers
      Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
      And I have entered 70 into the calculator
      When I press add
      Then the result should be 120 on the screen

    More Examples:
      | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |
      | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |
      | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |
      | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |

Languages that are not updated yet will have to use "More Examples" until we get the translations.

Tables can also be used as arguments to individual steps. In fact, steps now support a single argument
that can span several lines. This can be a table or a string.

Example:

  Given the following people exist:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
    | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
  When I search for email.com
  Then I should see:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
  And I should see:
    "Some text
    on several lines"

The step definitions for such multiline steps must define an extra block argument for the argument:

  Given /the following people exist:/ do |people_table|
    # people_table is of type Cucumber::Model::Table
    # See RDoc for more info
  end

  Then /I should see:/ do |string|
    # string is a plain old ruby String with leading spaces on each line removed
  end

=== New features
* Added profile formatter. (#35, Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Chinese Simplified. (Liming Lian)
* Added support for Dutch. (Sjoerd Tieleman)
* Multiline steps are now supported. (#4, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Tables used to define more examples for a scenario must be prefixed "More Examples" (see languages.yml for other languages)
* Show the file and line number for scenarios as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the file for the feature as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the feature file and line for pending steps as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed speling errors in Spanish (Daniel Cadenas)
* ActionMailer delivery_method should not be set to test (#41, Luke Melia)
* Reverse incorrectly ordered args in webrat select step (#43, David Chelimsky)
* Support comments above the first scenario (#31, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed the HTML Formatter to use actual values for FIT table headers (#30, Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* Removed the /^I go to (.*)$/ step from common_webrat.rb - it's not language agnostic and provides little value.

=== New features
* Added new --out option to make it easier to specify output from Rake and cucumber.yml

== 0.1.7 2008-10-05

This release fixes a few bugs and adds some new features. The most notable features are:

=== Calling steps from steps

Step definitions are a little bit closer to having regular method semantics.
You define them, but now you can also call them from other steps. Here is an
example:

  Given /I am logged in as an (.*) named (.*)$/ do |role, name|
    Given "I am registered as #{role}, #{name}, secret"
    When "I log in with #{name}, secret"
  end

  Given /I am registered as (.*), (.*), (.*)/ do |role, name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

  When /I log in with (.*), (.*)/ do |name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

This means that steps can be reused in other steps. The GivenScenario feature achieves a similar
effect (on the scenario level), but this feature is something we're not very happy with, mostly
because it's not parameterisable. Calling steps from steps is.

GivenScenario will still be working several releases, but the plan is to remove it completely in
the 0.3.0 release.

=== Seeing where a step is defined

Prior to this release it could be hard to find out where the ruby step definition matching
a plain text step is defined. Not anymore! Cucumber will now output this:

  Scenario: Regular numbers
    Given I have entered 3 into the calculator   # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    And I have entered 2 into the calculator     # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    When I press divide                          # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:16
    Then the result should be 1.5 on the screen  # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:20
    And the result class should be Float         # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:24

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug in the command line args being lost when using --profile (#27, Joseph Wilk)
* Fixed a bug in Webrat selects (Tim Glen)
* Fixed parsing of DOS line endings (#2, #28, Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Steps can be called from other steps (#3, Bryan Helmkamp, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added But keyword to all languages (#21, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added --no-source option to display step definition location next to step text (#26, Joseph Wilk, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added more Webrat steps (#25, Tim Glen)

== 0.1.6 2008-10-01

First gem release!
