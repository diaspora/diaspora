Here you'll find examples for Watir, FireWatir, SafariWatir and Celerity.
All of these browser libraries have the same API, so the example code will
work with all of them.

Just run with:

  rake cucumber
  
This will use Watir/IE if you're on Windows, and SafariWatir/Safari if you're on OS X.
You can force the use of FireWatir/Firefox on any platform like this:

  rake features FIREWATIR=true
  
And finally, you can use Celerity by running in JRuby:

  jruby -S rake cucumber
