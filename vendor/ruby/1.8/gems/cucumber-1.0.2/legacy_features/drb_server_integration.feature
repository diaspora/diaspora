Feature: DRb Server Integration
  To prevent waiting for Rails and other large Ruby applications to load their environments
  for each feature run Cucumber ships with a DRb client that can speak to a server which
  loads up the environment only once.

  Background: App with Spork support
    Spork is a gem that has a DRb server and the scenarios below illustrate how to use it.
    However, any DRb server that adheres to the protocol that the client expects would work.

    Given a standard Cucumber project directory structure
    And a file named "features/support/env.rb" with:
      """
      require 'rubygems'
      require 'spork'

      Spork.prefork do
        puts "I'm loading all the heavy stuff..."
      end

      Spork.each_run do
        puts "I'm loading the stuff just for this run..."
      end
      """
    And a file named "features/sample.feature" with:
      """
      # language: en
      Feature: Sample
        Scenario: this is a test
          Given I am just testing stuff
      """
    And a file named "features/essai.feature" with:
      """
      # language: fr
      Fonctionnalit√©: Essai
        Scenario: ceci est un test
          Soit je teste

    And a file named "features/step_definitions/all_your_steps_are_belong_to_us.rb" with:

    Given /^I am just testing stuff$/ do
      # no-op
    end

    Soit /^je teste$/ do
      # no-op
    end
    """

  Scenario: Feature Passing with --drb flag
    Given I am running spork in the background

    When I run cucumber features --drb
    Then it should pass
    And STDERR should be empty
    And the output should contain
      """
      1 step (1 passed)
      """
    And the output should contain
      """

  Scenario: Feature Failing with --drb flag
    Given a file named "features/step_definitions/all_your_steps_are_belong_to_us.rb" with:
    """
    Given /^I am just testing stuff$/ do
      raise "Oh noes!"

      """

  Scenario: Feature Run with --drb flag with no DRb server running
            Cucumber will fall back on running the features locally in this case.

    Given I am not running a DRb server in the background

    When I run cucumber features --drb
    Then it should pass
    And STDERR should match
      """

  Scenario: Feature Run with --drb flag *defined in a profile* with no DRb server running

    Given I am not running a DRb server in the background
    And the following profile is defined:
      """
      server: --drb features
      """

    When I run cucumber --profile server
    Then it should pass

      """

  Scenario: Feature Run with --drb specifying a non-standard port

    Given I am running spork in the background on port 9000

    When I run cucumber features --drb --port 9000
    Then it should pass
    And STDERR should be empty
    And the output should contain

  Scenario: Feature Run with $CUCUMBER_DRB environment variable

    Given I have environment variable CUCUMBER_DRB set to "9000"
    And I am running spork in the background on port 9000
