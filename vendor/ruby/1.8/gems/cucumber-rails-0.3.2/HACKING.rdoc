= Hacking on Cucumber-Rails

If you have a bugfix or a new feature you want to contribute, please fork on Github and make your own feature branch:

  git clone git@github.com:you/cucumber-rails.git
  git checkout -b 87-add-chinese-translation

The feature branch should contain a ticket number (if appliccable) and a descriptive name that aligns with the ticket name.

== Setting up your environment

Before you change anything, you should make sure you can run all the Cucumber features for Cucumber-Rails. You need rvm.

  sudo gem install rvm
  rvm install ruby-1.8.7-p249 ruby-1.9.1-p378

== Running all features

  rake cucumber
  
This takes a long time because a lot of gems have to be installed. (This is done while running the cucumber features)
