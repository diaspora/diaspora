= Cucumber-Rails

Cucumber-Rails brings Cucumber to Rails2 and Rails3. It contains 2 generators - one
for bootstrapping your Rails app for Cucumber, and a second one for generating features.

Cucumber-Rails also contains Cucumber Step Definitions that wrap Capybara or Webrat,
giving you a head start for writing Cucumber features against your Rails app.

== Installation

=== Rails 3:

Before you can use the generator, add the necessary gems to your project's Gemfile as follows:

  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
  gem 'cucumber-rails'
  gem 'cucumber', '0.7.2'
  gem 'rspec-rails', '2.0.0.beta.8'
  gem 'spork'
  gem 'launchy'    # So you can do Then show me the page

Then install the gems by running:

  bundle install

Learn about the various options:

  ruby script/rails generate cucumber:install --help

Finally, bootstrap your Rails app, for example:

  ruby script/rails generate cucumber:install --rspec --capybara

=== Rails 2.x:

Before you can use the generator, install the gem by running:

  gem install cucumber-rails

Learn about the various options:

  ruby script/generate cucumber --help

Finally, bootstrap your Rails app, for example:

  ruby script/generate cucumber --rspec --capybara

== Generating a Cucumber feature

IMPORTANT: Only do this if you are new to Cucumber. We recommend you write your
Cucumber features by hand once you get the hang of it.

=== Rails 3:

Example:

  ruby script/rails generate cucumber:feature post title:string body:text published:boolean
  ruby script/rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean
  rake db:migrate
  rake cucumber

=== Rails 2:

Example:

  ruby script/generate feature post title:string body:text published:boolean
  ruby script/generate scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean
  rake db:migrate
  rake cucumber
