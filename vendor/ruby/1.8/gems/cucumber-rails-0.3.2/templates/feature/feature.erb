  Scenario: Register new <%= singular_name %>
    Given I am on the new <%= singular_name %> page
<% keyword = 'When' -%>
<% named_args.each do |arg| -%>
<% if arg.type == 'boolean' -%>
    <%= keyword %> I uncheck "<%= arg.name.humanize %>"
<% else -%>
    <%= keyword %> I fill in "<%= arg.name.humanize %>" with "<%= arg.value(1) %>"
<% end -%>
<% keyword = 'And' -%>
<% end -%>
    And I press "Create"
<% keyword = 'Then' -%>
<% named_args.each do |arg| -%>
    <%= keyword %> I should see "<%= arg.value(1) %>"
<% keyword = 'And' -%>

  # Rails generates Delete links that use Javascript to pop up a confirmation
  # dialog and then do a HTTP POST request (emulated DELETE request).
  #
  # Capybara must use Culerity/Celerity or Selenium2 (webdriver) when pages rely
  # on Javascript events. Only Culerity/Celerity supports clicking on confirmation
  # dialogs.
  #
  # Since Culerity/Celerity and Selenium2 has some overhead, Cucumber-Rails will
  # detect the presence of Javascript behind Delete links and issue a DELETE request 
  # instead of a GET request.
  #
  # You can turn this emulation off by tagging your scenario with @no-js-emulation.
  # Turning on browser testing with @selenium, @culerity, @celerity or @javascript
  # will also turn off the emulation. (See the Capybara documentation for 
  # details about those tags). If any of the browser tags are present, Cucumber-Rails
  # will also turn off transactions and clean the database with DatabaseCleaner 
  # after the scenario has finished. This is to prevent data from leaking into 
  # the next scenario.
  #
  # Another way to avoid Cucumber-Rails' javascript emulation without using any
  # of the tags above is to modify your views to use <button> instead. You can
  # see how in http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues#issue/12

  Scenario: Delete <%= singular_name %>
    Given the following <%= plural_name %>:
      |<%= named_args.map(&:name).join('|') %>|
<% (1..4).each do |n| -%>
      |<%= named_args.map{|arg| arg.value(n)}.join('|') %>|
<% end -%>
    When I delete the 3rd <%= singular_name %>
    Then I should see the following <%= plural_name %>:
      |<%= named_args.map{|arg| arg.name.humanize}.join('|') %>|
<% [1,2,4].each do |n| -%>
      |<%= named_args.map{|arg| arg.value(n)}.join('|') %>|
<% end -%>
