= Daemons Release History

== Release 1.1.4: June 17, 2011

* Do not change the umask to 0000 when daemonizing anymore, just leave it as it 
  was (thanks to Jon Botelho).

== Release 1.1.3: April 14, 2011

* Fixed a bug in Application.stop: the cached pid number needs to
  be used to check for the status of a killed process (thanks to Jimmy Sieben).
  
== Release 1.1.2: March 29, 2011

* Fixed gemspec to include all needed files.
  
== Release 1.1.1: March 29, 2011

* Make the logging facilities work in :mode => :none (i.e. when calling 
  Daemons.daemonize) (thanks to the input from Peter Hegedus).
  
== Release 1.1.0: June 20, 2010

* Honour the options[:app_name] in Daemons.daemonize (thanks to Ryan Tecco).
* Included a new option :stop_proc to specify a proc that will be called when a 
  daemonized process receives a request to stop (thanks to Dave Dupre).
* Only delete the pidfile if the current pid is the original pid (ghazel).
* Start when restart but no application running (pcreux).
* Silently continue if there is no pidfile (ghazel).
* We now per default wait for processes to stop and
  kill them automatically it if they do not stop within a given time 
  (force_kill_waittime). Use the option --no_wait to not wait for processes to 
  stop.
* Set log files mode to 0644 (mikehale).
* Set pid file permissions to 0644 (mikehale).
* Added ability to change process uid/gid (mikehale).
* Fix for: If you happen to start a daemon from a process that has open file 
  descriptors these will stay open. As it is daemonize.rb only closes ruby IO 
  objects (thanks to Han Holl).
* New reload command (SIGHUP) (thanks to Michael Schuerig).

== Release 1.0.10: March 21, 2008

* By default, we now delete stray pid-files (i.e. pid-files which result for 
  example from a killed daemon) automatically. This function can be deactivated 
  by passing :keep_pid_files => true as an option.
* All pid files of :multiple daemons new get deleted correctly upon exit of the 
  daemons (reported by Han Holl).
* Use the signal 'KILL' instead of 'TERM' on Windows platforms.
* Use exit! in trap('TERM') instead of exit when option :hard_exit is given 
  (thanks to Han Holl).
* Did some clarification on the exception log.

== Release 1.0.9: October 29, 2007

* fixed a severe bug in the new Pid.running? function: function returned true if
  the process did not exist (thanks to Jeremy Lawler).

== Release 1.0.8: September 24, 2007

* new Pid.running? function. Checking whether a process exists by sending 
  signal '0' (thanks to Dru Nelson).

== Release 1.0.7: July 7, 2007

* Patch to fix wrong ARGV when using :exec (in def start_exec: 
  Kernel.exec(script(), *(@app_argv || []))) (thanks to Alex McGuire).

== Release 1.0.6: Mai 8, 2007

* New option to pass an ARGV-style array to run and run_proc (thanks to Marc Evans).
* Additional patches for '/var/log' (thanks to Marc Evans).

== Release 1.0.5: February 24, 2007

* Applied patch that makes daemons to use '/var/log' as logfile 
  directory if you use :dir_mode = :system (thanks to Han Holl).
* Daemons should now work with Ruby 1.9 (at least the basic features).

== Release 1.0.4: January 17, 2007

* Document the :log_output option (thanks to Andrew Kuklewicz).
* Set STDOUT.sync = true when redirecting to a logfile (thanks to Andrew Kuklewicz).
* Should now run also correctly when there is no working 'ps ax' on the system 
  (thanks to Daniel Kehoe).

== Release 1.0.3: November 1, 2006

* Set the app_name correctly also for the monitor process (thanks to Ilya Novoselov).

== Release 1.0.2: September 26, 2006

* Changed the 'ps -ax' call back to 'ps ax'.
* Fixed the documentation for the :normal :dir_mode.
* As a default for Daemons.run_proc, the pid file is now saved in the current directory.
* In :ontop mode for running a proc (this is equal to calling something like 'ruby ctrl_proc.rb run'), 
  the proc now runs directly in the calling script, not in a forked process anymore (thanks to Paul Butcher).
* Set $0 to app_name in the daemons (thanks to Ilya Novoselov).

== Release 1.0.1: August 30, 2006

* Fixed a regex for parsing the 'ps ax' system call. (thanks to Garance Alistair Drosehn)

== Release 1.0.0: August 29, 2006

* Fix the parsing of the 'ps ax' system call. (thanks to Garance Alistair Drosehn)

== Release 0.4.4: February 14, 2006

* Several fixes that allow us to use the Daemons::Controller 
  with a proc instead of wrapping a script file. This gives us all the
  PID file management, monitoring, command line options, etc. without having
  to specify a path to our script which can be tricky, especially when using
  RubyGems. (thanks to John-Mason Shackelford)

== Release 0.4.3: November 29, 2005

* New Option: You can specify the name of the application with :app_name
  on calling Daemons.run. This will be used to contruct the name of the pid files
  and log files. Defaults to the basename of the script. (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)

* Bugfix: Handle the case where no controller options are given when calling Daemons, 
  just options after "--". (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)


== Release 0.4.2: November 15, 2005

* Bugfix for problem with :normal pid-file directory mode (pid.rb), fixed (thanks to Stephen R. Veit)


== Release 0.4.1: September 11, 2005

* Bugfix for 'run' command line mode: didn't work anymore in 0.4.0, fixed


== Release 0.4.0: July 30, 2005

* Two completely new operation modes:
  1. Call a block as a daemon (<tt>Daemons.call { my_daemon_code }</tt>)
     and control it from the parent process.
  2. Daemonize the currently running process (<tt>Daemons.daemonize</tt>)
  plus the already existing mode to control your scripts (<tt>Daemons.run("script.rb")</tt>)
* Improved documentation (for example "How does the daemonization process work?")
* Improved "simulation mode" (<tt>:ontop</tt> option)
* Some minor bugfixes


== Release 0.3.0: April 21, 2005

* New monitor functionality: automatic restarting of your applications if they crash
* 'restart' command fixed
* '--force' command modifier (please refer to the documentation)
* Some more bugfixes and improvements

== Release 0.2.0: Mar 21, 2005

* Exec functionality added
* More examples added
* New commands: status, zap


== Release 0.0.1: Feb 8, 2005
