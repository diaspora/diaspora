# All functions and classes that Daemons provides reside in this module.
#
# Daemons is normally invoked by one of the following four ways:
#
# 1.  <tt>Daemons.run(script, options)</tt>:
#     This is used in wrapper-scripts that are supposed to control other ruby scripts or
#     external applications. Control is completely passed to the daemons library.
#     Such wrapper script need to be invoked with command line options like 'start' or 'stop'
#     to do anything useful.
#
# 2.  <tt>Daemons.run_proc(app_name, options) { (...) }</tt>:
#     This is used in wrapper-scripts that are supposed to control a proc. 
#     Control is completely passed to the daemons library.
#     Such wrapper script need to be invoked with command line options like 'start' or 'stop'
#     to do anything useful.
#
# 3.  <tt>Daemons.call(options) { block }</tt>:
#     Execute the block in a new daemon. <tt>Daemons.call</tt> will return immediately
#     after spawning the daemon with the new Application object as a return value.
#
# 4.  <tt>Daemons.daemonize(options)</tt>:
#     Daemonize the currently runnig process, i.e. the calling process will become a daemon.
#
# == What does daemons internally do with my daemons?
# *or*:: why do my daemons crash when they try to open a file?
# *or*:: why can I not see any output from the daemon on the console (when using for example +puts+)?
#
# From a technical aspect of view, daemons does the following when creating a daemon:
#
# 1.  Forks a child (and exits the parent process, if needed)
# 2.  Becomes a session leader (which detaches the program from
#     the controlling terminal).
# 3.  Forks another child process and exits first child. This prevents
#     the potential of acquiring a controlling terminal.
# 4.  Changes the current working directory to "/".
# 5.  Clears the file creation mask (sets +umask+ to 0000).
# 6.  Closes file descriptors (reopens +STDOUT+ and +STDERR+ to point to a logfile if
#     possible).
#
# So what does this mean for your daemons:
# - the current directory is '/'
# - you cannot receive any input from the console (for example no +gets+)
# - you cannot output anything from the daemons with +puts+/+print+ unless a logfile is used
#
# == How do PidFiles work? Where are they stored?
#
# Also, you are maybe interested in reading the documentation for the class PidFile.
# There you can find out about how Daemons works internally and how and where the so
# called <i>PidFiles</i> are stored.

module Daemons

  VERSION = "1.1.4"
  
  require 'daemons/daemonize'
  
  
  # Passes control to Daemons.
  # This is used in wrapper-scripts that are supposed to control other ruby scripts or
  # external applications. Control is completely passed to the daemons library.
  # Such wrapper script should be invoked with command line options like 'start' or 'stop'
  # to do anything useful.
  #
  # +script+::  This is the path to the script that should be run as a daemon.
  #             Please note that Daemons runs this script with <tt>load <script></tt>.
  #             Also note that Daemons cannot detect the directory in which the controlling
  #             script resides, so this has to be either an absolute path or you have to run
  #             the controlling script from the appropriate directory.
  #
  # +options+:: A hash that may contain one or more of the options listed below
  #
  # === Options:
  # <tt>:app_name</tt>::  The name of the application. This will be
  #                       used to contruct the name of the pid files
  #                       and log files. Defaults to the basename of
  #                       the script.
  # <tt>:ARGV</tt>::      An array of strings containing parameters and switches for Daemons.
  #                       This includes both parameters for Daemons itself and the controlled scripted.
  #                       These are assumed to be separated by an array element '--', .e.g.
  #                       ['start', 'f', '--', 'param1_for_script', 'param2_for_script'].
  #                       If not given, ARGV (the parameters given to the Ruby process) will be used.
  # <tt>:dir_mode</tt>::  Either <tt>:script</tt> (the directory for writing the pid files to 
  #                       given by <tt>:dir</tt> is interpreted relative
  #                       to the script location given by +script+, the default) or <tt>:normal</tt> (the directory given by 
  #                       <tt>:dir</tt> is interpreted as a (absolute or relative) path) or <tt>:system</tt> 
  #                       (<tt>/var/run</tt> is used as the pid file directory)
  #
  # <tt>:dir</tt>::       Used in combination with <tt>:dir_mode</tt> (description above)
  # <tt>:multiple</tt>::  Specifies whether multiple instances of the same script are allowed to run at the
  #                       same time
  # <tt>:ontop</tt>::     When given (i.e. set to true), stay on top, i.e. do not daemonize the application 
  #                       (but the pid-file and other things are written as usual)
  # <tt>:mode</tt>::      <tt>:load</tt> Load the script with <tt>Kernel.load</tt>;
  #                       note that :stop_proc only works for the :load (and :proc) mode.
  #                       <tt>:exec</tt> Execute the script file with <tt>Kernel.exec</tt>
  # <tt>:backtrace</tt>:: Write a backtrace of the last exceptions to the file '[app_name].log' in the 
  #                       pid-file directory if the application exits due to an uncaught exception
  # <tt>:monitor</tt>::   Monitor the programs and restart crashed instances
  # <tt>:log_dir</tt>::   A specific directory to put the log files into (when not given, resort to the default
  #                       location as derived from the :dir_mode and :dir options
  # <tt>:log_output</tt>:: When given (i.e. set to true), redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to a logfile named '[app_name].output' in the pid-file directory
  # <tt>:keep_pid_files</tt>:: When given do not delete lingering pid-files (files for which the process is no longer running).
  # <tt>:hard_exit</tt>:: When given use exit! to end a daemons instead of exit (this will for example
  #                       not call at_exit handlers).
  # <tt>:stop_proc</tt>:: A proc that will be called when the daemonized process receives a request to stop (works only for :load and :proc mode)

  #
  # +app_name+::  The name of the application. This will be
