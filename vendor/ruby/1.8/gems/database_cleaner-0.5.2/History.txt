0.5.x (In Git)

== 0.5.2

 === Bugfixes
  * Removes extraneous puts call from configuration.rb.  (Ben Mabey)

== 0.5.1 - The Mongoid Release

This release also attempts to fix AR for Rails 3 support.  I have seen mixed reviews on this.  Some people
claim the fixes allow for use in Rails3 while others have not had good luck with it.  I plan on reworking
the way AR support is added so that it is more friendly with how Rails 3 uses autoload.
