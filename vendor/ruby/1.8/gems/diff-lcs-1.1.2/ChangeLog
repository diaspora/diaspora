Revision history for Ruby library Diff::LCS. Unless explicitly noted otherwise,
all changes are produced by Austin Ziegler <diff-lcs@halostatue.ca>.

== Diff::LCS 1.1.2
* Fixed a problem reported by Mauricio Fernandez in htmldiff. Future versions
  of Diff::LCS will be removing this program.

== Diff::LCS 1.1.1
* Fixed bug #891:
  http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=407&aid=891&group_id=84
* Fixed a problem with callback initialisation code (it assumed that all
  callbacks passed as classes can be initialised; now, it rescues
  NoMethodError in the event of private :new being called).
* Modified the non-initialisable callbacks to have a private #new method.
* Moved ldiff core code to Diff::LCS::Ldiff (diff/lcs/ldiff.rb).

== Diff::LCS 1.1.0
* Eliminated the need for Diff::LCS::Event and removed it.
* Added a contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallback.
* Implemented patching/unpatching for standard Diff callback output formats
  with both #diff and #sdiff.
* Extensive documentation changes.

== Diff::LCS 1.0.4
* Fixed a problem with bin/ldiff output, especially for unified format.
  Newlines that should have been present weren't.
* Changed the .tar.gz installer to generate Windows batch files if ones do not
  exist already. Removed the existing batch files as they didn't work.

== Diff::LCS 1.0.3
* Fixed a problem with #traverse_sequences where the first difference from the
  left sequence might not be appropriately captured.

== Diff::LCS 1.0.2
* Fixed an issue with ldiff not working because actions were changed from
  symbols to strings.

== Diff::LCS 1.0.1
* Minor modifications to the gemspec, the README.
* Renamed the diff program to ldiff (as well as the companion batch file) so as
  to not collide with the standard diff program.
* Fixed issues with RubyGEMs. Requires RubyGems > 0.6.1 or >= 0.6.1 with the
  latest CVS version.

== Diff::LCS 1.0
* Initial release based mostly on Perl's Algorithm::Diff.
