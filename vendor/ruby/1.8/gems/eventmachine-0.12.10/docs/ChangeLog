01Oct06: Replaced EventMachine#open_datagram_server with a version that can
  take a Class or a Module, instead of just a Module. Thanks to Tobias
  Gustafsson for pointing out the missing case.
04Oct06: Supported subsecond timer resolutions, per request by Jason Roelofs.
05Oct06: Added EventMachine#set_quantum, which sets the timer resolution.
15Nov06: Added Connection#set_comm_inactivity_timeout.
15Nov06: Checked in a Line-and-Text Protocol Handler.
18Nov06: Checked in a Header-and-Body Protocol Handler.
22Nov06: Changed EventMachine#reconnect: no longer excepts when called on an
         already-connected handler.
28Nov06: Supported a binary-unix gem.
19Dec06: Added EventMachine#set_effective_user.
05Jan07: Upped max outstanding timers to 1000.
15May07: Applied Solaris patches from Brett Eisenberg
22May07: Cleaned up the license text in all the source files.
22May07: Released version 0.7.2

23May07: Per suggestion from Bill Kelly, fixed a bug with the initialization
 	of the network libraries under Windows. The goal is to enable EM to
	be used without Ruby.
28May07: Applied patch from Bill Kelly, refactors the declarations of
	event names to make EM easier to use from C programs without Ruby.
31May07: Added a preliminary implementation of EventMachine#popen.
01Jun07: Added EM, a "pseudo-alias" for EventMachine.
01Jun07: Added EM#next_tick.
01Jun07: Added EM::Connection#get_outbound_data_size
05Jun07: Removed the code which loads a pure-Ruby EM library in case the
	compiled extension is unavailable. Suggested by Moshe Litvin.
06Jun07: Preliminary epoll implementation.
12Jun07: Added an evented popen implementation that, like Ruby's, is
	full-duplex and makes the subprocess PID available to the caller.
06Jul07: Performance-tweaked the callback dispatcher in eventmachine.rb.
10Jul07: Released version 0.8.0.
12Jul07: Applied patches from Tim Pease to fix Solaris build problems.

	suitable for use with JRuby.
17Jul07: Added EventMachine#stop_server, per request from Kirk Haines,
	and associated unit tests.
22Jul07: Added EventMachine#stream_file_data. This is a very fast and scalable
	way of sending data from static files over network connections. It
	has separate implementations for small files and large file, and
	has tunings to minimize memory consumption.
26Jul07: Added some patches by Kirk Haines to improve the behavior of
	EM::Connection#send_file_data_to_connection.
26Jul07: Added a C++ module for directly integrating EM into C++ programs
	with no Ruby dependencies. Needs example code.

	used to specify client-side private keys and certificates.

24Aug07: Added a preliminary keyboard handler. Needs docs and testing on
	windows.

	processes.
27Aug07: Silenced some -w warnings, requested by James Edward Gray II.

04Sep07: Added an initial implementation of an evented SMTP server.
10Sep07: Changed EM#spawn to run spawned blocks in the context of the
	SpawnedProcess object, not of whatever was the active object at the
	time of the spawn.
14Sep07: Heartbeats weren't working with EPOLL. Noticed by Brian Candler.
15Sep07: Added some features, tests and documents to Deferrable.
16Sep07: Added [:content] parameter to EM::Protocols::SmtpClient#send.
16Sep07: Bumped version to 0.9.0 in anticipation of a release.
18Sep07: Released version 0.9.0.
19Sep07: Added #receive_reset to EM::Protocols::SmtpServer.
19Sep07: User overrides of EM::Protocols::SmtpServer#receive_recipient can now
	return a Deferrable. Also fixed bug: SmtpClient now raises a protocol
	error if none of its RCPT TO: commands are accepted by the server.
26Sep07: Fixed missing keyboard support for Windows.
03Oct07: Added a default handler for RuntimeErrors emitted from user-written
	code. Suggested by Brian Candler.

10Nov07: Forced integer conversion of send_datagram's port parameter.
Suggested by Matthieu Riou.
12Nov07: Added saslauth.rb, a protocol module to replace the Cyrus SASL
daemons saslauthd and pwcheck.
15Nov07: Fixed bug reported by Mark Zvillius. We were failing to dispatch
	zero-length datagrams under certain conditions.
19Nov07: Added EventMachine#set_max_timers. Requested by Matthieu Riou and
	others.
19Nov07: Fixed bug with EM::Connection#start_tls. Was not working with server
	connections. Reported by Michael S. Fischer.
26Nov07: Supported a hack for EventMachine#popen so it can return an exit
	status from subprocesses. Requested by Michael S. Fischer.
30Nov07: Changed Pipe descriptors so that the child-side of the socketpair is
	NOT set nonblocking. Suggested by Duane Johnson.
05Dec07: Re-enabled the pure-Ruby implementation.
06Dec07: Released Version 0.10.0.
13Dec07: Added EM::DeferrableChildProcess
24Dec07: Added a SASL client for simple password authentication.
27Dec07: Removed the hookable error handler. No one was using it and it significantly
	degraded performance.
30Dec07: Implemented Kqueue support for OSX and BSD.
04Jan08: Fixed bug in epoll ("Bad file descriptor"), patch supplied by Chris
	Heath.
04Jan08: Fixed bug reported by Michael S. Fischer. We were terminating
	SSL connections that sent data before the handshake was complete.
08Jan08: Added an OpenBSD branch for extconf.rb, contributed by Guillaume
	Sellier.
19Jan08: Added EM::Connection::get_sockname per request by Michael Fischer.
19Jan08: Supported IPv6 addresses.
30Apr08: Set the NODELAY option on sockets that we connect to other servers.
	Omission noted by Roger Pack.
14May08: Generated a 0.12 release.
15May08: Supported EM#get_sockname for acceptors (TCP server sockets).
	Requested by Roger Pack.
15May08; Accepted a patch from Dan Aquino that allows the interval of a
	PeriodicTimer to be changed on the fly.
15Jun08: Supported nested calls to EM#run. Many people contributed ideas to
	this, notably raggi and tmm1.
20Jul08: Accepted patch from tmm1 for EM#fork_reactor.
28Jul08: Added a Postgres3 implementation, written by FCianfrocca.
14Aug08: Added a patch by Mike Murphy to support basic auth in the http
client.
28Aug08: Added a patch by tmm1 to fix a longstanding problem with Java
data-sends.
13Sep08: Added LineText2#set_binary_mode, a back-compatibility alias.
13Sep08: Modified the load order of protocol libraries in eventmachine.rb
	to permit a modification of HeaderAndContentProtocol.
13Sep08: Modified HeaderAndContent to use LineText2, which is less buggy
	than LineAndTextProtocol. This change may be reversed if we can fix
	the bugs in buftok.
13Sep08: Improved the password handling in the Postgres protocol handler.
15Sep08: Added attach/detach, contributed by Aman Gupta (tmm1) and Riham Aldakkak,
	to support working with file descriptors not created in the reactor.
16Sep08: Added an optional version string to the HTTP client. This is a hack
	that allows a client to specify a version 1.0 request, which
	keeps the server from sending a chunked response. The right way to
	solve this, of course, is to support chunked responses.
