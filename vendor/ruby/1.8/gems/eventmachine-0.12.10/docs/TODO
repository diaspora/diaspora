TODO List:

12Aug06: Noticed by Don Stocks. A TCP connect-request that results
in a failed DNS resolution fires a fatal error back to user code.
Uuuuuugly. We should probably cause an unbind event to get fired
instead, and add some parameterization so the caller can detect
the nature of the failure.
