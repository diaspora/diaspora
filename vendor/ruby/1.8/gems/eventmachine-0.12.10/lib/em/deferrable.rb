    # will cause the callback block to be stored on an internal list.
    # If you call this method on a Deferrable whose status is :succeeded, the
    # block will be executed immediately, receiving the parameters given to the
    # prior #set_deferred_status call.
    #

    # If there is no status, add a callback to an internal list.
    # If status is succeeded, execute the callback immediately.
    # If status is failed, do nothing.

    # Sets the "disposition" (status) of the Deferrable object. See also the large set of
    # sugarings for this method.
    # Note that if you call this method without arguments,
    # no arguments will be passed to the callback/errback.
    # If the user has coded these with arguments, then the
    # user code will throw an argument exception.
    # Implementors of deferrable classes <b>must</b>
    # document the arguments they will supply to user callbacks.
    #
    # OBSERVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL here: you may call this method even
    # on the INSIDE of a callback. This is very useful when a previously-registered
    # callback wants to change the parameters that will be passed to subsequently-registered
    # ones.
    #
    # You may give either :succeeded or :failed as the status argument.
    #
    # If you pass :succeeded, then all of the blocks passed to the object using the #callback
    # method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the #set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks
    # passed to the object using #errback will be discarded.
    #
    # If you pass :failed, then all of the blocks passed to the object using the #errback
    # method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the #set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks
    # passed to the object using # callback will be discarded.
    #
    # If you pass any arguments to #set_deferred_status in addition to the status argument,
    # they will be passed as arguments to any callbacks or errbacks that are executed.
    # It's your responsibility to ensure that the argument lists specified in your callbacks and
    # errbacks match the arguments given in calls to #set_deferred_status, otherwise Ruby will raise
    # an ArgumentError.
    #
    #--
    # We're shifting callbacks off and discarding them as we execute them.
    # This is valid because by definition callbacks are executed no more than
    # once. It also has the magic effect of permitting recursive calls, which
    # means that a callback can call #set_deferred_status and change the parameters
    # that will be sent to subsequent callbacks down the chain.
    #
    # Changed @callbacks and @errbacks from push/shift to unshift/pop, per suggestion
    # by Kirk Haines, to work around the memory leak bug that still exists in many Ruby
    # versions.
    #
    # Changed 15Sep07: after processing callbacks or errbacks, CLEAR the other set of
    # handlers. This gets us a little closer to the behavior of Twisted's "deferred,"
    # which only allows status to be set once. Prior to making this change, it was possible
    # to "succeed" a Deferrable (triggering its callbacks), and then immediately "fail" it,
    # triggering its errbacks! That is clearly undesirable, but it's just as undesirable
    # to raise an exception is status is set more than once on a Deferrable. The latter
    # behavior would invalidate the idiom of resetting arguments by setting status from
    # within a callback or errback, but more seriously it would cause spurious errors
    # if a Deferrable was timed out and then an attempt was made to succeed it. See the
    # comments under the new method #timeout.
