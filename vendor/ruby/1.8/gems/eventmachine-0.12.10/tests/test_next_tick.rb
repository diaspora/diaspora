  # We now support an additional parameter for EM#run.
  # You can pass two procs to EM#run now. The first is executed as the normal
  # run block. The second (if given) is scheduled for execution after the
  # reactor loop completes.
  # The reason for supporting this is subtle. There has always been an expectation
  # that EM#run doesn't return until after the reactor loop ends. But now it's
  # possible to nest calls to EM#run, which means that a nested call WILL
  # RETURN. In order to write code that will run correctly either way, it's
  # recommended to put any code which must execute after the reactor completes
  # in the second parameter.
  #
  def test_run_run_2
    a = proc {EM.stop}
    b = proc {assert true}
    EM.run a, b

  # This illustrates that EM#run returns when it's called nested.
  # This isn't a feature, rather it's something to be wary of when writing code
  # that must run correctly even if EM#run is called while a reactor is already
  # running.
