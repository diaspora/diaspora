Http(s) EXtended CONnections

== Getting Started

  sudo gem install excon

Now you are ready to get started, easiest is to use one off requests to start.

  Excon.get('http://geemus.com')

This will return a response object, which has body, headers and status attributes you can check out.

This supports all the major http verbs: [connect, delete, get, head, options, post, put, trace]

You can also create a connection to try and keep open across multiple requests.

  connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com')
  connection.request(:method => 'GET')

You can also specify more complicated options to either style of call

  Excon.get('http://geemus.com', :headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})
  # or
  connection.request(:method => 'GET', :headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})

If you need to do something special with a response you can also pass a block that will be called with each chunk.

  Excon.get('http://geemus.com') {|chunk| p chunk }

From there you should be able to make just about any request you might need.
