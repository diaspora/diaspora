class Factory
  # Provides alternate syntaxes for factory_girl. If you don't like the default
  # syntax for defining or using factories, look at one of the Factory::Syntax
  # modules:
  #
  # * Factory::Syntax::Blueprint: definition syntax similar to Machinist
  # * Factory::Syntax::Generate: usage syntax similar to Object Daddy
  # * Factory::Syntax::Make: usage syntax similar to Machinist
  # * Factory::Syntax::Sham: sequence syntax similar to Machinist
