= Installing FasterCSV

RubyGems is the preferred easy install method for FasterCSV.  However, you can
install FasterCSV manually as described below.

== Installing the Gem

FasterCSV is intended to be installed via the
RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] system.  To get the latest
version, simply enter the following into your command prompt:

	$ sudo gem install fastercsv

You must have RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] installed for
the above to work.

If you want to build the gem locally, make sure you have
Rake[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rake/] installed then run the following
command:

  $ rake package

== Installing Manually

Download the latest version of FasterCSV from the
{RubyForge project page}[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1102].  Navigate to
the root project directory and enter:

	$ sudo ruby setup.rb

== Running the Tests

If you would like to run FasterCSV's test suite on your system before installing
and you have Rake installed, just issue the following command from the root of
the project directory:

  $ rake

If you do not have rake, use the following command instead:

  $ ruby -I lib:test test/ts_all.rb
