== 0.5.0 / 2009-10-06

* Major improvements
  * New Function class
  * Structs can be passed and returned by value
  * Implement a custom trampoline for x86_64, resulting in roughly 30% speedup
  * Improve dispatch of functions which take (0..6) char/short/int/long/pointer arguments by between 50% and 200% on x86_64
  * Callbacks are now approximately 100% faster on x86_64
* Minor improvements
  * Add support for MacOSX Snow Leopard
  * Improve support for Windows releasing fat binaries on rubyforge
  * Better introspection in structs:
    * Add StructLayout::Field#type, size, offset, alignment and name 
      methods
    * Add StructLayout#fields which returns an array of 
      StructLayout::Field objects
  * Add automagic deducing of library name from module name. 
    Idea and prototype implementation from Matt Hulse
  * Callback fields in structs can now be both read and written
  * Add a bunch of new benchmarks
  * Lots of refactoring
* Experimental features
  * blocking functions (i.e. native code that blocks the thread) support
* Bug fixes
  * Fix RUBY-FFI_43 (rake gem dependency)

  * Add AbstractMemory#get_array_of_string()
  * Implement Pointer.new(address) and Pointer.new(:type, address)
* Bug fixes

== 0.3.4 / 2009-05-01

* Minor improvements

    rb_raise is not declared noreturn, to avoid gcc warnings.

== 0.3.3 / 2009-04-27

* Minor improvements
  * Implement RUBY_FFI-16 - Add support for anonymous callbacks
  * Add support for callback parameters in callbacks
  * Add support for function pointer return values

* Bug fixes
  * Correctly save errno/GetLastError after each call.

== 0.3.0 / 2009-03-19

* Switch compilation to rake-compiler
  * Makes cross-compilation from linux -> win32 super easy
  * win32 support is available now, but highly experimental
* Performance improvements
  * struct field access approx 3x faster than 0.2.0
  * function invocation approx 20% faster than 0.2.0
* A bunch of minor improvements
  * Struct instances can now be passed as :pointer parameters without calling
    Struct#pointer
  * Support for array struct members
  * Structs are now padded correctly to the alignment of the struct's  
    largest field
  * Global library variables
  * Callbacks in global library variables
  * Strings passed in as :string arguments are scrubbed to avoid 
    poison-null-byte attacks.
  * Union support
  * nil can be passed as a :string argument (passed as NULL)
  * Structs can now be fields inside another struct
  * Lots of internal cleanups and refactorings.
