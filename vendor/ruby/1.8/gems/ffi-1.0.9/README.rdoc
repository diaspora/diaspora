== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby-FFI is a ruby extension for programmatically loading dynamic
libraries, binding functions within them, and calling those functions
from Ruby code. Moreover, a Ruby-FFI extension works without changes
on Ruby and JRuby. Discover why should you write your next extension
using Ruby-FFI here[http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi/why-use-ffi].

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* It has a very intuitive DSL
* It supports all C native types
* It supports C structs (also nested), enums and global variables
* It supports callbacks
* It has smart methods to handle memory management of pointers and structs

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'ffi'

  module MyLib
    extend FFI::Library
    ffi_lib 'c'
    attach_function :puts, [ :string ], :int
  end

  MyLib.puts 'Hello boys using libc!'

For less minimalistic and more sane examples you may look at:

* the samples/ folder
* the examples on the wiki[http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi]
* the projects using FFI listed on this page[http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi/projects-using-ffi]

== REQUIREMENTS:

* You need a sane building environment in order to compile the extension.

== DOWNLOAD/INSTALL:

From rubyforge:

  [sudo] gem install ffi

or from the git repository on github:

  git clone git://github.com/ffi/ffi.git
  cd ffi
  rake gem:install
