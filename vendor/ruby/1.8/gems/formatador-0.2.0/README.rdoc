STDOUT text formatting

== Quick and dirty

You can call class methods to print out single lines like this:

  Formatador.display_line('Hello World')

You use tags, similar to html, to set formatting options:

  Formatador.display_line('[green]Hello World[/]')

  [/] resets everything to normal, colors are supported and [_color_] sets the background color.

== Standard options

* format - and adds color codes if STDOUT.tty? is true
* display - calls format on the input and prints it
* display_line - calls display, but adds on a newline (\n)
* redisplay - Displays text, prepended with \r which will overwrite the last existing line

== Extensions

* display_table: takes an array of hashes. Each hash is a row, with the keys being the headers and values being the data. An optional second argument can specify which headers/columns to include and in what order they should appear.
* display_compact_table: Same as display_table, execpt that split lines are not drawn by default in the body of the table. If you need a split line, put a :split constant in the body array.
* redisplay_progressbar: takes the current and total values as its first two arguments and redisplays a progressbar (until current = total and then it display_lines). An optional third argument represents the start time and will add an elapsed time counter.

== Indentation

By initializing a formatador object you can keep track of indentation:

  formatador = Formatador.new
  formatador.display_line('one level of indentation')
  formatador.indent {
    formatador.display_line('two levels of indentation')
  }
  formatador.display_line('one level of indentation')
