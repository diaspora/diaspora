Fuubar is an instafailing "RSpec":http://github.com/rspec formatter that uses a progress bar instead of a string of letters and dots as feedback. Here's "a video of Fuubar in action":http://vimeo.com/16845253.

h2. Installation

Installing Fuubar is easy. Just put it in your @Gemfile@ and run your specs like this from now on:

If you want to use Fuubar as your default formatter, simply put the options in your @.rspec@ file:

bc. --format Fuubar
--color
