;; Version: 3.0.19
;; Created: 2007-03-08

;; Keywords: markup, language, html

;;; Commentary:

;; Because Haml's indentation schema is similar
;; to that of YAML and Python, many indentation-related
;; functions are similar to those in yaml-mode and python-mode.

;; To install, save this on your load path and add the following to
;; your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'haml-mode)

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))
(require 'ruby-mode)
