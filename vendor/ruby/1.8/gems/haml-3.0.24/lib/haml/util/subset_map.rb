    # A map from sets to values.
    # A value is \{#\[]= set} by providing a set (the "set-set") and a value,
    # which is then recorded as corresponding to that set.
    # Values are \{#\[] accessed} by providing a set (the "get-set")
    # and returning all values that correspond to set-sets
    # that are subsets of the get-set.
    #
    # SubsetMap preserves the order of values as they're inserted.
    #
    # @example
    # ssm = SubsetMap.new
    # ssm[Set[1, 2]] = "Foo"
    # ssm[Set[2, 3]] = "Bar"
    # ssm[Set[1, 2, 3]] = "Baz"
    #
    # ssm[Set[1, 2, 3]] #=> ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]
