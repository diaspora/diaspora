= Change Log

Below is a complete listing of changes for each revision of HighLine.

== 1.6.1

* Fixed raw_no_echo_mode so that it uses stty -icanon rather than cbreak
  as cbreak does not appear to be the posixly correct argument. It fails
  on Solaris if cbreak is used.
* Fixed an issue that kept Menu from showing the correct choices for 
  disambiguation.
* Removed a circular require that kept Ruby 1.9.2 from loading HighLine.
* Fixed a bug that caused infinite looping when wrapping text without spaces.
* Fixed it so that :auto paging accounts for the two lines it adds.
* On JRuby, improved error message about ffi-ncurses.  Before 1.5.3, 
  HighLine was silently swallowing error messages when ffi-ncurses gem
  was installed without ncurses present on the system.
* Reverted Aaron Simmons's patch to allow redirecting STDIN on Windows.  This
  is the only way we could find to restore HighLine's character reading to
  working order.

== 1.5.2

* Added support for using the ffi-ncurses gem which is supported in JRuby.
* Added gem build instructions.

* Worked around some API changes in Ruby's standard library in Ruby 1.9.
  (patch by Jake Benilov)

  would show up in the default responses.

== 1.0.0

* Fixed documentation typo pointed out by Gavin Kistner.
* Added <tt>gather = ...</tt> option to question for fetching entire Arrays or
  Hashes filled with answers.  You can set +gather+ to a count of answers to
  collect, a String or Regexp matching the end of input, or a Hash where each
  key can be used in a new question.
* Added File support to HighLine.ask().  You can specify a _directory_ and a
  _glob_ pattern that combine into a list of file choices the user can select
  from.  You can choose to receive the user's answer as an open filehandle or as
  a Pathname object.
* Added Readline support for history and editing.
* Added tab completion for menu  and file selection selection (requires
  Readline).
* Added an optional character limit for input.
* Added a complete help system to HighLine's shell menu creation tools.

== 0.6.1

* Removed termios dependancy in gem, to fix Windows' install.

== 0.6.0

* Implemented HighLine.choose() for menu handling.
  * Provided shortcut <tt>choose(item1, item2, ...)</tt> for simple menus.
  * Allowed Ruby code to be attached to each menu item, to create a complete
    menu solution.
  * Provided for total customization of the menu layout.
  * Allowed for menu selection by index, name or both.
  * Added a _shell_ mode to allow menu selection with additional details
    following the name.
* Added a list() utility method that can be invoked just like color().  It can
  layout Arrays for you in any output in the modes <tt>:columns_across</tt>,
  <tt>:columns_down</tt>, <tt>:inline</tt> and <tt>:rows</tt>
* Added support for <tt>echo = "*"</tt> style settings.  User code can now
  choose the echo character this way.

  available.  Will return to old behavior (using "stty"), if "termios" cannot be
  loaded.
* Improved "stty" state restoring code.
* Fixed "stty" code to handle interrupt signals.
* Improved the default auto-complete error message and exposed this message
  through the +responses+ interface as <tt>:no_completion</tt>.

== 0.5.0

  make fetching passwords trivial.
* Fixed an auto-complete bug that could cause a crash when the user gave an
  answer that didn't complete to any valid choice.
* Implemented +case+ for HighLine::Question objects to provide character case 
  conversions on given answers.  Can be set to <tt>:up</tt>, <tt>:down</tt>, or
  <tt>:capitalize</tt>.

  aware of incorrect input.
* Implemented +confirm+ for HighLine::Question objects to allow for verification
  for sensitive user choices.  If set to +true+, user will have to answer an
  "Are you sure?  " question.  Can also be set to the question to confirm with
  the user.

== 0.4.0

* Added <tt>@wrap_at</tt> and <tt>@page_at</tt> settings and accessors to
  HighLine, to control text flow.
* Implemented line wrapping with adjustable limit.
* Implemented paged printing with adjustable limit.

== 0.3.0

* Added support for installing with setup.rb.
* All output is now treated as an ERb sequence, allowing Ruby code to be
  embedded in output strings.
* Added support for ANSI color sequences in say().  (And everything else
  by extension.)
* Added whitespace handling for answers.  Can be set to <tt>:strip</tt>,
  <tt>:chomp</tt>, <tt>:collapse</tt>, <tt>:strip_and_collapse</tt>,
  <tt>:chomp_and_collapse</tt>, <tt>:remove</tt>, or <tt>:none</tt>.
* Exposed question details to ERb completion through @question, to allow for
  intelligent responses.
* Simplified HighLine internals using @question.
* Added support for fetching single character input either with getc() or
  HighLine's own cross-platform terminal input routine.
