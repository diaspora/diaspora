= Change Log

Below is a complete listing of changes for each revision of HighLine.

== 1.6.2

* Correctly handle STDIN being closed before we receive any data (fix by
  mleinart).
* Try if msvcrt, if we can't load crtdll on Windows (fix by pepijnve).
* A fix for nil_on_handled not running the action (reported by Andrew Davey).

== 1.6.1

* Fixed raw_no_echo_mode so that it uses stty -icanon rather than cbreak
  as cbreak does not appear to be the posixly correct argument. It fails
  on Solaris if cbreak is used.
* Fixed an issue that kept Menu from showing the correct choices for 
  disambiguation.
* Removed a circular require that kept Ruby 1.9.2 from loading HighLine.
* Fixed a bug that caused infinite looping when wrapping text without spaces.
* Fixed it so that :auto paging accounts for the two lines it adds.
* On JRuby, improved error message about ffi-ncurses.  Before 1.5.3, 
  HighLine was silently swallowing error messages when ffi-ncurses gem
  was installed without ncurses present on the system.
* Reverted Aaron Simmons's patch to allow redirecting STDIN on Windows.  This
  is the only way we could find to restore HighLine's character reading to
  working order.

== 1.5.2

* Added support for using the ffi-ncurses gem which is supported in JRuby.
* Added gem build instructions.

== 1.5.1

* Fixed the long standing echo true bug.
  (reported by Lauri Tuominen)
* Improved Windows API calls to support the redirection of STDIN.
  (patch by Aaron Simmons)

* Made a minor documentation clarification about character mode support.
* Worked around some API changes in Ruby's standard library in Ruby 1.9.
  (patch by Jake Benilov)

  adding support for Solaris.  (patch by Ronald Braswell and Coey Minear)

  libraries may want to access.

  would show up in the default responses.

== 1.0.0

* Fixed documentation typo pointed out by Gavin Kistner.
* Added <tt>gather = ...</tt> option to question for fetching entire Arrays or
  Hashes filled with answers.  You can set +gather+ to a count of answers to
  collect, a String or Regexp matching the end of input, or a Hash where each
  key can be used in a new question.
* Added File support to HighLine.ask().  You can specify a _directory_ and a
  _glob_ pattern that combine into a list of file choices the user can select
  from.  You can choose to receive the user's answer as an open filehandle or as
  a Pathname object.
* Added Readline support for history and editing.
* Added tab completion for menu  and file selection selection (requires
  Readline).
* Added an optional character limit for input.
* Added a complete help system to HighLine's shell menu creation tools.

== 0.6.1

* Removed termios dependancy in gem, to fix Windows' install.

== 0.6.0

* Implemented HighLine.choose() for menu handling.
  * Provided shortcut <tt>choose(item1, item2, ...)</tt> for simple menus.
  * Allowed Ruby code to be attached to each menu item, to create a complete
    menu solution.
  * Provided for total customization of the menu layout.
  * Allowed for menu selection by index, name or both.
  * Added a _shell_ mode to allow menu selection with additional details
    following the name.
* Added a list() utility method that can be invoked just like color().  It can
  layout Arrays for you in any output in the modes <tt>:columns_across</tt>,
  <tt>:columns_down</tt>, <tt>:inline</tt> and <tt>:rows</tt>
* Added support for <tt>echo = "*"</tt> style settings.  User code can now
  choose the echo character this way.

  available.  Will return to old behavior (using "stty"), if "termios" cannot be
  loaded.
* Improved "stty" state restoring code.
* Fixed "stty" code to handle interrupt signals.
* Improved the default auto-complete error message and exposed this message
  through the +responses+ interface as <tt>:no_completion</tt>.

== 0.5.0

* Implemented <tt>echo = false</tt> for HighLine::Question objects, primarily to
  make fetching passwords trivial.
* Fixed an auto-complete bug that could cause a crash when the user gave an
  answer that didn't complete to any valid choice.
* Implemented +case+ for HighLine::Question objects to provide character case 
  conversions on given answers.  Can be set to <tt>:up</tt>, <tt>:down</tt>, or
  <tt>:capitalize</tt>.
* Exposed <tt>@answer</tt> to the response system, to allow response that are
  aware of incorrect input.
* Implemented +confirm+ for HighLine::Question objects to allow for verification
  for sensitive user choices.  If set to +true+, user will have to answer an
  "Are you sure?  " question.  Can also be set to the question to confirm with
  the user.

== 0.4.0

* Added <tt>@wrap_at</tt> and <tt>@page_at</tt> settings and accessors to
  HighLine, to control text flow.
* Implemented line wrapping with adjustable limit.
* Implemented paged printing with adjustable limit.

== 0.3.0

* Added support for installing with setup.rb.
* All output is now treated as an ERb sequence, allowing Ruby code to be
  embedded in output strings.
* Added support for ANSI color sequences in say().  (And everything else
  by extension.)
* Added whitespace handling for answers.  Can be set to <tt>:strip</tt>,
  <tt>:chomp</tt>, <tt>:collapse</tt>, <tt>:strip_and_collapse</tt>,
  <tt>:chomp_and_collapse</tt>, <tt>:remove</tt>, or <tt>:none</tt>.
* Exposed question details to ERb completion through @question, to allow for
  intelligent responses.
* Simplified HighLine internals using @question.
* Added support for fetching single character input either with getc() or
  HighLine's own cross-platform terminal input routine.

* Fixed the bug causing ask() to swallow NoMethodErrors.
* Rolled ask_on_error() into responses.
* Redirected imports to Kernel from Object.
