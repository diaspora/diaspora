== DESCRIPTION

Launchy is helper class for launching cross-platform applications in a
fire and forget manner.

There are application concepts (browser, email client, etc) that are
common across all platforms, and they may be launched differently on
each platform.  Launchy is here to make a common approach to launching
external application from within ruby programs.

== FEATURES

Currently only launching a browser is supported.

== SYNOPSIS

From within your ruby code you can trust launchy to do the right thing:

    Launchy.open("http://www.ruby-lang.org/")

Or, if you want to launch the application yourself:

    Launchy::Browser.run("http://www.ruby-lang.org/")

OR

    Launchy::Browser.new.visit("http://www.ruby-lang.org/")
