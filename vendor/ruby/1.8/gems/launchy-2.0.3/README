== DESCRIPTION

Launchy is helper class for launching cross-platform applications in a
fire and forget manner.

There are application concepts (browser, email client, etc) that are
common across all platforms, and they may be launched differently on
each platform. Launchy is here to make a common approach to launching
external application from within ruby programs.

== FEATURES

Currently only launching a browser is supported.

== SYNOPSIS

You can use launchy on the commandline, or via its API.

=== Commandline

    % launchy http://www.ruby-lang.org/

There are additional commandline options, use 'launchy --help' to see them.

=== Public API

In the vein of {Semantic Versioning}[http://semver.org], starting with version 2.0.0, this is the
sole supported public API.

    Launchy.open( uri, options = {} )

At the moment, the only available options are:

    :debug        Turn on debugging output
    :application  Explicitly state what application class is going to be used
    :host_os      Explicitly state what host operating system to pretend to be
    :ruby_engine  Explicitly state what ruby engine to pretend to be under
    :dry_run      Do nothing and print the command that would be executed on $stdout

An example of using the public API:

    Launchy.open( "http://www.ruby-lang.org" )
