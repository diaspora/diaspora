= LineCache - Module to read and cache lines of a file

== Summary

  require 'linecache'
  lines = LineCache::getlines('/tmp/myruby.rb')
  # The following lines have same effect as the above.
  $: << '/tmp'
  Dir.chdir('/tmp') {lines = LineCache::getlines('myruby.rb')

  line = LineCache::getline('/tmp/myruby.rb', 6)
  # Note lines[6] == line (if /tmp/myruby.rb has 6 lines)

  LineCache::clear_file_cache
  LineCache::clear_file_cache('/tmp/myruby.rb')
  LineCache::update_cache   # Check for modifications of all cached files.

== Credits

  This is a port of the module of the same name from the Python distribution.

  The idea for how TraceLineNumbers works, and some code was taken
  from ParseTree by Ryan Davis.
