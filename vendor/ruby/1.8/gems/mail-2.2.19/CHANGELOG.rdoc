* Version bump to 2.1.1

== Mon Jan 25 10:36:33 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Now passes a block to the delivery handler, which can just call yield if it want's Mail to just do it's normal delivery method
* Moved Mail.deliveries into Mail::TestMailer.deliveries. Now only gets mail appended to it if you are sending with the :test delivery_method (only for testing)
* Version bump to 2.1.0

== Mon Jan 25 01:44:13 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Change :deliver! to deliver a mail object, bypassing the :perform_deliveries and :raise_delivery_errors flags, also does not append the mail object to Mail.deliveries, thus the ! (dangerous).  The intended use for :deliver! is for people wanting to have their own delivery_handler (like ActionMailer uses) to track and handle delivery failures.
* Added :delivery_handler to Message.  Allows you to pass an object that will be sent :deliver_mail(self) by the Mail::Message instance when it is sent :deliver and bypasses the usual delivery method.
* Changed :perform_deliveries flag to be more consistent with it's name, mail will not append itself to the Mail.deliveries collection if :perform_deliveries is false

== Sat Jan 23 23:49:50 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.5

* Version bump to 2.0.4
* Added :perform_deliveries to mail, will not actually call deliver on the delivery method if this is set to false, set to true by default.
* Added @delivery_notification_observers to mail messages, you can register an observer with mail by calling mail.register_for_delivery_notification(observer) and then when mail is told to :deliver it will call your observer with observer.delivered_email(self).  It will call your observer if it actually performed the delivery or not (that is, irregardless of the :perform_deliveries flag)
* Added ability to overwrite the Mail.deliveries store with an object of your choice instead of just an array, this is a good way to find out if something actually got delivered as if :perform_deliveries is false, this collection will not get the mail message appended

== Sat Jan 23 05:32:53 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.3
* Made body.sort_parts! recursive, to do the entire body

* Message now adds multipart/mixed as the content type if nothing is set and there are parts to the message
* Added #display_names and #addrs to all address fields.  #addrs returns the actual Mail::Address object for each address in the field.
* Body should call to_s on given input... incase someone gave it an IO.readlines result (Array)
*

== Thu Jan 21 05:27:17 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.2
* Major change to attachments, add_file now only accepts
  {:filename => 'full/path/to/file.png'} or
  {:filename => 'file.png', :content => 'string of file content'}
  you can also now do mail.attachments['filename.png'] = File.read('path/to/file.png')
  which is nice too!

== Fri Jan 15 09:20:51 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Rewrote all network classes to not use singletons.  Means different Mail::Message objects can have different delivery methods.

* Fixed that return-path should only return one address

== Thu Jan 14 10:41:22 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version update to 1.6.0 - API change on mail.address_fields to always return arrays
* Updated all message.address_field methods to always return arrays, so mail.from #=> ['one@address.com'] now, is least surprise

== Thu Jan 12 10:41:47 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version 1.5.3, handling invalid input on fields.  Highly recommended update
* Updated fields to always try parsing the given data (unless blank). This allows mail to catch invalid input and return UnstructuredFields. Makes mail a lot more resistant to invalid input.

== Sun Jan  3 00:08:06 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.5.0

* Major API change in Message#field_name.  This WILL break your applications that use Mail.  Message#field_name now returns good, intelligent, default values.  You can still access the field object by calling Message#[:field_name] or Message#['field_name'].

== Sat Jan  2 04:12:53 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Message-ID, Content-ID, References et al, now return the default value of the message ID without the angle brackets, as per RFC 2822, "Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket characters."

* Message class now has getter and setter methods for all the supported field types explicitly.  This allows us to return a "default" value for all fields.

* All address fields, when called from Message#to or Message#from or the like, return either a string of the address spec (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) if it is a single entry, or an array of address specs if there is more than one ['mikel@test.lindsaar.net', 'ada@test.lindsaar.net']

== Mon 28 Dec 2009 01:21:52 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

  nil
* Version bump to 1.4.1

== Sun Dec 27 09:51:27 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.4 because now :to_s calls :decoded for all fields and body
  while :to_s calls :encoded for Message and Header containers.  Makes sense...
  really.

== Sun Dec 27 07:30:02 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Changed fields to default to :decoded on :to_s, all container objects
  retain :encoded as the default for :to_s

* Handled unstructured field folding "blank" lines
* Fixed error in header.rb that created fields into an array, instead of a FieldList, resulting
  in mail.encode returning a random sort order on the header.
* Made unstructured fields attempt to decode their values on :decode

* 2b5d608: Closes Issue #2 - Empty header field values not parsing <mikel>
* Version bumb to 1.2.1

== Wed Nov  4 12:54:43 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Renamed Mail::Message.encode! to Mail::Message.ready_to_send!, deprecated :encode! <mikel>
* Rewrote encoding and decoding methods on all classes.  Adds a lot of boiler plate code, but allows us to
  be really precise in each field type that needs custom encoding.  Now all encoding is done by the field_type
  itself.  Need to follow through on the body. <mikel>
* Bump version to 1.2.0 due to changes of :encoded, :decoded behaviour <mikel>

* Tested mail against entire Enron set (2.3gb) and the Trec 2005 set (0.5gb), ~ half a million emails without crashing <jlindley>
* Some headers only can appear once, enforce during header parse assignment. <jlindley>
* Convert empty bodies into empty arrays instead of nil. <jlindley>
* Handle blank content dispositions. <jlindley>
* Mention Trec 2005 Spam Corpus in readme <jlindley>
* Add 'rake corpus:verify_all' to allow parse checks in bulk. <jlindley>
* Added handling of multi value parameters, like filename*1*="us-ascii'en'blah" filename*2="bleh" <mikel>
* Added dependency on ActiveSupport 2.3 or higher <mikel>

== Sun Nov  1 12:00:00 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* handle OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE returning 0 <jlindley>
* doing Mail.new { content_type [text, plain, { charset => UTF-8 }] } is now
  possible (content type accepts an array) <mikel>

== Sat Oct 31 11:00:41 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Fixed attachment handling, so mail can find attachment from a content-type,
content-disposition or content-location
* Added content-location field and parser
* Added message.has_attachments? for ActionMailer friendliness
* Added attachment.original_filename for ActionMailer friendliness
