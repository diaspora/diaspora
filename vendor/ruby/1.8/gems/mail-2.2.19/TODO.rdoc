== Not really in any order:

* Add multibyte handling to fields, if they get a multibyte string, try encoding it into 
  UTF-8 B first, if this fails, throw an error.

* Cleanup the treetop parsers......... do I _really_ need that many entrance files?

* Simplify the relationship of Headers and Fields.  Doing too much of the Field work
  in the Header class on instantiating fields.  Header should just say "Field, do it!"
