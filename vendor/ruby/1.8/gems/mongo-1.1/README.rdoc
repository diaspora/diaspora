= Introduction

This is the 10gen-supported Ruby driver for MongoDB[http://www.mongodb.org].

Here's a quick code sample. See the MongoDB Ruby Tutorial
(http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Tutorial) for much more.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mongo'
  include Mongo

  db   = Connection.new.db('sample-db')
  coll = db.collection('test')

  coll.remove
  3.times do |i|
    coll.insert({'a' => i+1})
  end
  puts "There are #{coll.count()} records. Here they are:"
  coll.find().each { |doc| puts doc.inspect }

= Installation

=== Ruby Versions

The driver works and is consistently tested on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, and 1.9.1.

Note that if you're on 1.8.7, be sure that you're using a patchlevel >= 249. There
are some IO bugs in earlier versions.

=== Gems

The driver's gems are hosted at Rubygems.org[http://rubygems.org]. Make sure you're
using the latest version of rubygems:

  $ gem update --system

Then you can install the mongo gem as follows:

  $ gem install mongo

The driver also requires the BSON gem:

  $ gem install bson

And for a significant performance boost, you'll want to install the C extensions:

  $ gem install bson_ext

=== From the GitHub source

The source code is available at http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver.
You can either clone the git repository or download a tarball or zip file.
Once you have the source, you can use it from wherever you downloaded it or
you can install it as a gem from the source by typing

  $ rake gem:install

To install the C extensions from source, type this instead:

  $ rake gem:install_extensions

That's all there is to it!

= Examples

For extensive examples, see the MongoDB Ruby Tutorial
(http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Tutorial).

Bundled with the driver are many examples, located in the "examples" subdirectory. Samples include using
the driver and using the GridFS class GridStore. MongoDB must be running for
these examples to work, of course.

Here's how to start MongoDB and run the "simple.rb" example:

  $ cd path/to/mongo
  $ ./mongod run
  ... then in another window ...
  $ cd path/to/mongo-ruby-driver
  $ ruby examples/simple.rb

See also the test code, especially test/test_db_api.rb.

= GridFS

Note: The GridStore class has been deprecated. Use either the Grid or GridFileSystem
classes to take advantage of GridFS.

The Ruby driver include two abstractions for storing large files: Grid and GridFileSystem.
The Grid class is a Ruby implementation of MongoDB's GridFS file storage
specification. GridFileSystem is essentailly the same, but provides a more filesystem-like API
and assumes that filenames are unique.

An instance of both classes represents an individual file store. See the API reference
for details, and see examples/gridfs.rb for code that uses many of the Grid
features (metadata, content type, seek, tell, etc).

Examples:
  include Mongo

  # Get a database
  db = Mongo::Connection.new.db('app-db')

  # GridFileSystem. Store the text "Hello, world!" in the fs.
  fs = GridFileSystem.new(db)
  fs.open('filename', 'w') do |f|
    f.write "Hello, world!"
  end

  # GridFileSystem. Output "Hello, world!"
  fs = GridFileSystem.new(db)
  fs.open('filename', 'r') do |f|
    puts f.read
  end

  # Write a file on disk to the Grid
  file = File.open('image.jpg')
  grid = Grid.new(db)
  id   = grid.put(file)

  # Retrieve the file
  file = grid.get(id)
  file.read

  # Get all the file's metata
  file.filename
  file.content_type
  file.metadata

= Notes

== Thread Safety

The driver is thread-safe.

== Connection Pooling

As of 0.18, the driver implements connection pooling. By default, only one
socket connection will be opened to MongoDB. However, if you're running a
multi-threaded application, you can specify a maximum pool size and a maximum
timeout for waiting for old connections to be released to the pool.

To set up a pooled connection to a single MongoDB instance:

  @conn = Connection.new("localhost", 27017, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5)

A pooled connection to a paired instance would look like this:

  @conn = Connection.new({:left  => ["db1.example.com", 27017],
                    :right => ["db2.example.com", 27017]}, nil,
                    :pool_size => 20, :timeout => 5)

Though the pooling architecture will undoubtedly evolve, it currently owes much credit
to the connection pooling implementations in ActiveRecord and PyMongo.

== Using with Phusion Passenger

When passenger is in smart spawning mode you need to be sure that child
processes forked by passenger will create a new connection to the database.
activerecord-mongo-adapter handles this for you, so if you are using that
you shouldn't need to worry about it. Otherwise you'll either need to use
conservative spawning[http://www.modrails.org/documentation/Users%20guide.html#RailsSpawnMethod]
or handle reconnecting when passenger forks a new process:

  if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
    PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
      if forked
        # Call db.connect to reconnect here
      end
    end
  end

The above code should be put in _environment.rb_ or in an initialization
script.

See this thread[http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/f31e2d23de38136a]
for more details on this issue.

== String Encoding

The BSON ("Binary JSON") format used to communicate with Mongo requires that
strings be UTF-8 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

Ruby 1.9 has built-in character encoding support. All strings sent to Mongo
and received from Mongo are converted to UTF-8 when necessary, and strings
read from Mongo will have their character encodings set to UTF-8.

When used with Ruby 1.8, the bytes in each string are written to and read from
Mongo as-is. If the string is ASCII all is well, because ASCII is a subset of
UTF-8. If the string is not ASCII, it may not be a well-formed UTF-8
string.

== Primary Keys

The field _id is a primary key. It is treated specially by the database, and
its use makes many operations more efficient. The value of an _id may be of
any type. The database itself inserts an _id value if none is specified when
a record is inserted.

=== Primary Key Factories

A primary key factory is a class you supply to a DB object that knows how to
generate _id values. If you want to control _id values or even their types,
using a PK factory lets you do so.

You can tell the Ruby Mongo driver how to create primary keys by passing in
the :pk option to the Connection#db method.

  db = Mongo::Connection.new.db('dbname', :pk => MyPKFactory.new)

A primary key factory object must respond to :create_pk, which should
take a hash and return a hash which merges the original hash with any
primary key fields the factory wishes to inject.

NOTE: if the object already has a primary key, the factory should not
inject a new key; this means that the object may already exist in the
database.  The idea here is that whenever a record is inserted, the
:pk object's +create_pk+ method will be called and the new hash
returned will be inserted.

Here is a sample primary key factory, taken from the tests:

  class TestPKFactory
    def create_pk(row)
      row['_id'] ||= Mongo::ObjectID.new
      row
    end
  end

Here's a slightly more sophisticated one that handles both symbol and string
keys. This is the PKFactory that comes with the MongoRecord code (an
ActiveRecord-like framework for non-Rails apps) and the AR Mongo adapter code
(for Rails):

  class PKFactory
    def create_pk(row)
      return row if row[:_id]
      row.delete(:_id)      # in case it exists but the value is nil
      row['_id'] ||= Mongo::ObjectID.new
      row
    end
  end

A database's PK factory object may be set either when a DB object is created
or immediately after you obtain it, but only once. The only reason it is
changeable at all is so that libraries such as MongoRecord that use this
driver can set the PK factory after obtaining the database but before using it
for the first time.

== The DB Class

=== Primary Key factories

See the section on "Primary Keys" above.

=== Strict mode

Each database has an optional strict mode. If strict mode is on, then asking
for a collection that does not exist will raise an error, as will asking to
create a collection that already exists. Note that both these operations are
completely harmless; strict mode is a programmer convenience only.

To turn on strict mode, either pass in :strict => true when obtaining a DB
object or call the :strict= method:

  db = Connection.new.db('dbname', :strict => true)
  # I'm feeling lax
  db.strict = false
  # No, I'm not!
  db.strict = true

The method DB#strict? returns the current value of that flag.

== Cursors

Random cursor fun facts:

- Cursors are enumerable.

- The query doesn't get run until you actually attempt to retrieve data from a
  cursor.

- Cursors have a to_a method.


= Testing

If you have the source code, you can run the tests. There's a separate rake task for testing with
the bson_ext C extension enabled.

  $ rake test:c

Or, to test without the extension:

  $ rake test:ruby

These will run both unit and functional tests. To run these tests alone:

  $ rake test:unit
  $ rake test:functional

To run any individual rake tasks with the C extension enabled, just pass C_EXT=true to the task:

  $ rake test:unit C_EXT=true

If you want to test replica pairs, you can run the following tests
individually:

  $ rake test:pair_count
  $ rake test:pair_insert
  $ rake test:pair_query

It's also possible to test replica pairs with connection pooling:

  $ rake test:pooled_pair_insert

===Shoulda and Mocha

Running the test suite requires shoulda and mocha.  You can install them as follows:

  $ gem install shoulda
  $ gem install mocha

The tests assume that the Mongo database is running on the default port. You
can override the default host (localhost) and port (Connection::DEFAULT_PORT) by
using the environment variables MONGO_RUBY_DRIVER_HOST and
MONGO_RUBY_DRIVER_PORT.

This documentation is available online at http://api.mongodb.org/ruby. You can
generate the documentation if you have the source by typing

  $ rake ydoc

Then open the file +ydoc/index.html+.
