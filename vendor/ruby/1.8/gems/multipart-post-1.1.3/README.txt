* http://github.com/nicksieger/multipart-post

== DESCRIPTION:

Adds a streamy multipart form post capability to Net::HTTP. Also
supports other methods besides POST.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Appears to actually work. A good feature to have.
* Encapsulates posting of file/binary parts and name/value parameter parts, similar to 
  most browsers' file upload forms.
* Provides an UploadIO helper class to prepare IO objects for inclusion in the params
  hash of the multipart post object.

== SYNOPSIS:

    require 'net/http/post/multipart'

    url = URI.parse('http://www.example.com/upload')
    File.open("./image.jpg") do |jpg|
      req = Net::HTTP::Post::Multipart.new url.path,
        "file" => UploadIO.new(jpg, "image/jpeg", "image.jpg")
      res = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|
        http.request(req)
      end
    end

== REQUIREMENTS:

None

== INSTALL:
