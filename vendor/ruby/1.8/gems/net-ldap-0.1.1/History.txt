* Fixing a critical problem with sockets.

=== Net::LDAP 0.1.0 / 2010-03-17
* Small fixes throughout, more to come.
* Ruby 1.9 support added.
* Ruby 1.8.6 and below support removed. If we can figure out a compatible way
  to reintroduce this, we will.
* New maintainers, new project repository location. Please see the README.txt.

=== Net::LDAP 0.0.5 / 2009-03-xx
* 13 minor enhancements:
  * Added Net::LDAP::Entry#to_ldif
  * Supported rootDSE searches with a new API.
  * Added [preliminary (still undocumented) support for SASL authentication.
  * Supported several constructs from the server side of the LDAP protocol.
  * Added a "consuming" String#read_ber! method.
  * Added some support for SNMP data-handling.
  * Belatedly added a patch contributed by Kouhei Sutou last October.
    The patch adds start_tls support.
  * Added Net::LDAP#search_subschema_entry
  * Added Net::LDAP::Filter#parse_ber, which constructs Net::LDAP::Filter
    objects directly from BER objects that represent search filters in
    LDAP SearchRequest packets.
  * Added Net::LDAP::Filter#execute, which allows arbitrary processing
    based on LDAP filters.
  * Changed Net::LDAP::Entry so it can be marshalled and unmarshalled.
    Thanks to an anonymous feature requester who only left the name
    "Jammy."
  * Added support for binary values in Net::LDAP::Entry LDIF conversions
    and marshalling.
  * Migrated to 'hoe' as the new project droid.
* 14 bugs fixed:
  * Silenced some annoying warnings in filter.rb. Thanks to "barjunk"
    for pointing this out.
  * Some fairly extensive performance optimizations in the BER parser.
  * Fixed a bug in Net::LDAP::Entry::from_single_ldif_string noticed by
    Matthias Tarasiewicz.
  * Removed an erroneous LdapError value, noticed by Kouhei Sutou.
  * Supported attributes containing blanks (cn=Babs Jensen) to
    Filter#construct. Suggested by an anonymous Rubyforge user.
  * Added missing syntactic support for Filter ANDs, NOTs and a few other
    things.
  * Extended support for server-reported error messages. This was provisionally
    added to Net::LDAP#add, and eventually will be added to other methods.
  * Fixed bug in Net::LDAP#bind. We were ignoring the passed-in auth parm.
    Thanks to Kouhei Sutou for spotting it.
  * Patched filter syntax to support octal \XX codes. Thanks to Kouhei Sutou
    for the patch.
  * Applied an additional patch from Kouhei.
  * Allowed comma in filter strings, suggested by Kouhei.
  * 04Sep07, Changed four error classes to inherit from StandardError rather
    Exception, in order to be friendlier to irb. Suggested by Kouhei.
  * Ensure connections are closed. Thanks to Kristian Meier.
  * Minor bug fixes here and there.

=== Net::LDAP 0.0.4 / 2006-08-15
* Undeprecated Net::LDAP#modify. Thanks to Justin Forder for
  providing the rationale for this.
* Added a much-expanded set of special characters to the parser
  for RFC-2254 filters. Thanks to Andre Nathan.
* Changed Net::LDAP#search so you can pass it a filter in string form.
  The conversion to a Net::LDAP::Filter now happens automatically.
* Implemented Net::LDAP#bind_as (preliminary and subject to change).
  Thanks for Simon Claret for valuable suggestions and for helping test.
* Fixed bug in Net::LDAP#open that was preventing #open from being
  called more than one on a given Net::LDAP object.

=== Net::LDAP 0.0.3 / 2006-07-26
* Added simple TLS encryption.
  Thanks to Garett Shulman for suggestions and for helping test.

* Fixed malformation in distro tarball and gem.
* Improved documentation.
* Supported "paged search control."

* Thanks to Andre Nathan, andre@digirati.com.br, for valuable
  suggestions.
* Added support for LE and GE search filters.
* Added support for Search referrals.
* Fixed a regression with openldap 2.2.x and higher caused
  by the introduction of RFC-2696 controls. Thanks to Andre
  Nathan for reporting the problem.
* Added support for RFC-2254 filter syntax.

=== Net::LDAP 0.0.1 / 2006-05-01
* Initial release.
* Client functionality is near-complete, although the APIs
  are not guaranteed and may change depending on feedback
  from the community.
* We're internally working on a Ruby-based implementation
  of a full-featured, production-quality LDAP server,
  which will leverage the underlying LDAP and BER functionality
  in Net::LDAP.
* Please tell us if you would be interested in seeing a public
  release of the LDAP server.
* Grateful acknowledgement to Austin Ziegler, who reviewed
  this code and provided the release framework, including
  minitar.
