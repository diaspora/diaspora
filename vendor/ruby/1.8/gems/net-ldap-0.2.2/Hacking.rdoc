= Hacking on Net::LDAP

We welcome your contributions to Net::LDAP. We accept most contributions, but
there are ways to increase the chance of your patch being accepted quickly.

== Licensing

Net::LDAP 0.2 and later are be licensed under an MIT-style license; any
contributions after 2010-04-20 must be under this license to be accepted.

== Formatting

* Your patches should be formatted like the rest of Net::LDAP.
* We use a text wrap of 76â€“78 characters, especially for documentation
  contents.
* Operators should have spaces around them.
* Method definitions should have parentheses around arguments (and no
  parentheses if there are no arguments).
* Indentation should be kept as flat as possible; this may mean being more
  explicit with constants.


We welcome your contributions to Net::LDAP. To increase the chances of your
patches being accepted, we recommend that you follow the guidelines below:

== Documentation

* Documentation: {net-ldap}[http://net-ldap.rubyforge.org/]

It is very important that, if you add new methods or objects, your code is
well-documented. The purpose of the changes should be clearly described so that
even if this is a feature we do not use, we can understand its purpose.

We also encourage documentation-only contributions that improve the
documentation of Net::LDAP.

We encourage you to provide a good summary of your as a modification to
+History.rdoc+, and if you're not yet named as a contributor, include a
modification to +Contributors.rdoc+ to add yourself.

== Tests

The Net::LDAP team uses RSpec for unit testing; all changes must have rspec
tests for any new or changed features.

Your changes should have been tested against at least one real LDAP server; the
current tests are not sufficient to find all possible bugs. It's unlikely that
they will ever be sufficient given the variations in LDAP server behaviour.

If you're introducing a new feature, it would be preferred for you to provide
us with a sample LDIF data file for importing into LDAP servers for testing.

== Development Dependencies

Net::LDAP uses several libraries during development, all of which can be
installed using RubyGems.

* *hoe-git*
* *metaid*
* *rspec*
* *flexmock*
