  # Implementor's note 20100320(AZ): RFC 4511 (the LDAPv3 protocol) as well
  # as earlier RFCs 1777 and 2559 seem to indicate that LDAP only has
  # application constructed sequences (0x60). However, ldapsearch sends some
  # context-specific constructed sequences (0xA0); other clients may do the
  # same. This behaviour appears to violate the RFCs. In real-world
  # practice, we may need to change calls of #to_ber_appsequence to
  # #to_ber_contextspecific for full LDAP server compatibility.
  #
  # This note probably belongs elsewhere.
