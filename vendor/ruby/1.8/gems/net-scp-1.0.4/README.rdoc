= Net::SCP

* http://github.com/net-ssh/net-scp

== DESCRIPTION:

Net::SCP is a pure-Ruby implementation of the SCP protocol. This operates over SSH (and requires the Net::SSH library), and allows files and directory trees to copied to and from a remote server.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Transfer files or entire directory trees to or from a remote host via SCP
* Can preserve file attributes across transfers
* Can download files in-memory, or direct-to-disk
* Support for SCP URI's, and OpenURI

== SYNOPSIS:

In a nutshell:

  require 'net/scp'

  # upload a file to a remote server
  Net::SCP.upload!("remote.host.com", "username",
    "/local/path", "/remote/path",
    :password => "password")

  # download a file from a remote server
  Net::SCP.download!("remote.host.com", "username",
    "/remote/path", "/local/path",
    :password => password)

  # download a file to an in-memory buffer
  data = Net::SCP::download!("remote.host.com", "username", "/remote/path")

  # use a persistent connection to transfer files
  Net::SCP.start("remote.host.com", "username", :password => "password") do |scp|
    # upload a file to a remote server
    scp.upload! "/local/path", "/remote/path"

    # upload from an in-memory buffer
    scp.upload! StringIO.new("some data to upload"), "/remote/path"

    # run multiple downloads in parallel
    d1 = scp.download("/remote/path", "/local/path")
    d2 = scp.download("/remote/path2", "/local/path2")
    [d1, d2].each { |d| d.wait }
  end

  # You can also use open-uri to grab data via scp:
  require 'uri/open-scp'
  data = open("scp://user@host/path/to/file.txt").read

For more information, see Net::SCP.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Net::SSH 2

If you wish to run the tests, you'll also need:

* Echoe (for Rakefile use)
* Mocha (for tests)

== INSTALL:

* gem install net-scp (might need sudo privileges)

Or, you can do it the hard way (without Rubygems):

* tar xzf net-scp-*.tgz
* cd net-scp-*
* ruby setup.rb config
* ruby setup.rb install (might need sudo privileges)
