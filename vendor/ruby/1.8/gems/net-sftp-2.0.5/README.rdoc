= Net::SFTP

* http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/sftp

== DESCRIPTION:

Net::SFTP is a pure-Ruby implementation of the SFTP protocol (specifically, versions 1 through 6 of the SFTP protocol). Note that this is the "Secure File Transfer Protocol", typically run over an SSH connection, and has nothing to do with the FTP protocol.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Transfer files or even entire directory trees to or from a remote host via SFTP
* Completely supports all six protocol versions
* Asynchronous and synchronous operation
* Read and write files using an IO-like interface

== SYNOPSIS:

In a nutshell:

  require 'net/sftp'

  Net::SFTP.start('host', 'username', :password => 'password') do |sftp|
    # upload a file or directory to the remote host
    sftp.upload!("/path/to/local", "/path/to/remote")

    # download a file or directory from the remote host
    sftp.download!("/path/to/remote", "/path/to/local")

    # grab data off the remote host directly to a buffer
    data = sftp.download!("/path/to/remote")

    # open and write to a pseudo-IO for a remote file
    sftp.file.open("/path/to/remote", "w") do |f|
      f.puts "Hello, world!\n"
    end

    # open and read from a pseudo-IO for a remote file
    sftp.file.open("/path/to/remote", "r") do |f|
      puts f.gets
    end

    # create a directory
    sftp.mkdir! "/path/to/directory"

    # list the entries in a directory
    sftp.dir.foreach("/path/to/directory") do |entry|
      puts entry.longname
    end
  end

For the full documentation, start with Net::SFTP::Session. Also see Net::SFTP::Operations::Upload, Net::SFTP::Operations::Download, Net::SFTP::Operations::FileFactory, Net::SFTP::Operations::File, and Net::SFTP::Operations::Dir.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Net::SSH 2

If you wish to run the tests, you'll need:

* Echoe (if you want to use the Rakefile)
* Mocha

== INSTALL:

* gem install net-sftp (might need sudo privileges)

Or, if you prefer to do it the hard way (sans Rubygems):

* tar xzf net-ssh-*.tgz
* cd net-ssh-*
* ruby setup.rb config
* ruby setup.rb install (might need sudo privileges)
