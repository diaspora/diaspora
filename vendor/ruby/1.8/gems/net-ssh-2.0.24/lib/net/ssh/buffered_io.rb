module Net; module SSH

  # This module is used to extend sockets and other IO objects, to allow
  # them to be buffered for both read and write. This abstraction makes it
  # quite easy to write a select-based event loop
  # (see Net::SSH::Connection::Session#listen_to).
  #
  # The general idea is that instead of calling #read directly on an IO that
  # has been extended with this module, you call #fill (to add pending input
  # to the internal read buffer), and then #read_available (to read from that
  # buffer). Likewise, you don't call #write directly, you call #enqueue to
  # add data to the write buffer, and then #send_pending or #wait_for_pending_sends
  # to actually send the data across the wire.
  #
  # In this way you can easily use the object as an argument to IO.select,
  # calling #fill when it is available for read, or #send_pending when it is
  # available for write, and then call #enqueue and #read_available during
  # the idle times.
  #
  #   socket = TCPSocket.new(address, port)
  #   socket.extend(Net::SSH::BufferedIo)
  #
  #   ssh.listen_to(socket)
  #
  #   ssh.loop do
  #     if socket.available > 0
  #       puts socket.read_available
  #       socket.enqueue("response\n")
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Note that this module must be used to extend an instance, and should not
  # be included in a class. If you do want to use it via an include, then you
  # must make sure to invoke the private #initialize_buffered_io method in
  # your class' #initialize method:
  #
  #   class Foo < IO
  #     include Net::SSH::BufferedIo
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       initialize_buffered_io
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #   end

  # Fixes for two issues by MiklÃ³s Fazekas:
  #
  #   * if client closes a forwarded connection, but the server is 
  #     reading, net-ssh terminates with IOError socket closed.
  #   * if client force closes (RST) a forwarded connection, but 
  #     server is reading, net-ssh terminates with [an exception]
