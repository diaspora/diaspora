  # A session class representing the connection service running on top of
  # the SSH transport layer. It manages the creation of channels (see
  # #open_channel), and the dispatching of messages to the various channels.
  # It also encapsulates the SSH event loop (via #loop and #process),
  # and serves as a central point-of-reference for all SSH-related services (e.g.
  # port forwarding, SFTP, SCP, etc.).
  #
  # You will rarely (if ever) need to instantiate this class directly; rather,
  # you'll almost always use Net::SSH.start to initialize a new network
  # connection, authenticate a user, and return a new connection session,
  # all in one call.
