  # A class for describing the current version of a library. The version
  # consists of three parts: the +major+ number, the +minor+ number, and the
  # +tiny+ (or +patch+) number.
  #
  # Two Version instances may be compared, so that you can test that a version
  # of a library is what you require:
  #
  #   require 'net/ssh/version'
  #
  #   if Net::SSH::Version::CURRENT < Net::SSH::Version[2,1,0]
  #     abort "your software is too old!"
