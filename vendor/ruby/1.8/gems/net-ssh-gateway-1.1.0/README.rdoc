= Net::SSH::Gateway

* http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/gateway

== DESCRIPTION:

Net::SSH::Gateway is a library for programmatically tunneling connections to servers via a single "gateway" host. It is useful for establishing Net::SSH connections to servers behind firewalls, but can also be used to forward ports and establish connections of other types, like HTTP, to servers with restricted access.

== FEATURES:

* Easily manage forwarded ports
* Establish Net::SSH connections through firewalls

== SYNOPSIS:

In a nutshell:

  require 'net/ssh/gateway'

  gateway = Net::SSH::Gateway.new('host', 'user')

  gateway.ssh("host.private", "user") do |ssh|
    puts ssh.exec!("hostname")
  end

  gateway.open("host.private", 80) do |port|
    Net::HTTP.get_print("127.0.0.1", "/path", port)
  end

  gateway.shutdown!

See Net::SSH::Gateway for more documentation.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* net-ssh (version 2)

If you want to run the tests or use any of the Rake tasks, you'll need:

* Echoe (for the Rakefile)
* Mocha (for the tests)

== INSTALL:
