= New Relic Ruby Agent

New Relic is a performance management system, developed by
New Relic, Inc (http://www.newrelic.com).  It provides you with deep
information about the performance of your Rails or Ruby
application as it runs in production. The New Relic Ruby Agent is
dual-purposed as a either a Rails plugin or a Gem, hosted on
github[http://github.com/newrelic/rpm/tree/master].

The New Relic Ruby Agent runs in one of two modes:

==== Production Mode

Low overhead instrumentation that captures detailed information on
your application running in production and transmits them to
newrelic.com where you can monitor them in real time.

==== Developer Mode

A Rack middleware that maps /newrelic to an application for showing
detailed performance metrics on a page by page basis.  Installed
automatically in Rails applications.

== Supported Environments

* Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.1, or 1.9.2, including REE
* JRuby 1.4 or higher
* Rails 2.0 or later for Production Mode
* Rails 2.3 or later for Developer Mode
* Sinatra
* Rack

Any Rack based framework should work but may not be tested.  Install
the Ruby Agent as a gem and add the Developer Mode middleware if
desired.  Report any problems to support@newrelic.com.

You can also monitor non-web applications. Refer to the "Other
Environments" section under "Getting Started".

= Getting Started

Install the Ruby Agent as a gem.  If you are using Rails you can
install the gem as a plug-in--details below.

   gem install newrelic_rpm

To monitor your applications in production, create an account at
http://newrelic.com/ .  There you can
sign up for a free Lite account or one of our paid subscriptions.

Once you receive the welcome e-mail with a license key and
+newrelic.yml+ file, copy the +newrelic.yml+ file into your app config
directory.

All agent configuration is done in the +newrelic.yml+ file.  This file
is by default read from the +config+ directory of the application root
and is subsequently searched for in the application root directory,
and then in a <tt>~/.newrelic</tt> directory

=== Rails Installation

You can install the agent as a Gem:

For Bundler:

Add the following line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'newrelic_rpm'

For Rails 2.x without Bundler:
   
edit +environment.rb+ and add to the initalizer block:

    config.gem "newrelic_rpm" 

=== Merb Installation

To monitor a merb app install the newrelic_rpm gem and add

    dependency 'newrelic_rpm'

to your init.rb file.

=== Sinatra Installation 

To use the Ruby Agent with a Sinatra app, add
    require 'newrelic_rpm'
in your Sinatra app, below the Sinatra require directive.

Then make sure you set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the
configuration definitions in the newrelic.yml file; i.e., development,
staging, production, etc.

To use Developer Mode in Sinatra, add NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode to 
the middleware stack.  See the +config.ru+ sample below.

=== Other Environments

You can use the Ruby Agent to monitor any Ruby application.  Add 
    require 'newrelic_rpm'
to your startup sequence and then manually start the agent using
    NewRelic::Agent.manual_start

To instrument Rack based applications, refer to the docs in
NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack.

Refer to the docs in New Relic for details on how to monitor other web
frameworks, background jobs, and daemons.

Also, see if your environment is already supported by the
rpm_contrib[http://newrelic.github.com/rpm_contrib] gem.

== Developer Mode

When running the Developer Mode, the Ruby Agent will track the
performance of every HTTP request serviced by your application, and
store in memory this information for the last 100 HTTP transactions.

To view this performance information, including detailed SQL statement
analysis, open +/newrelic+ in your web application.  For instance if
you are running mongrel or thin on port 3000, enter the following into
your browser:

    http://localhost:3000/newrelic

Developer Mode is only initialized if the +developer_mode+ setting in
the newrelic.yml file is set to true.  By default, it is turned off in
all environments but +development+.

==== Developer Mode in Rails

Developer Mode is available automatically in Rails Applications based
on Rails 2.3 and later.  No additional configuration is required. When
your application starts and +developer_mode+ is enabled, the Ruby
Agent injects a middleware into your Rails middleware stack.

For earlier versions of Rails that support Rack, you can use
a +config.ru+ as below.

==== Developer Mode in Rack Applications

Developer Mode is available for any Rack based application such as
Sinatra by installing the NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode
middleware. This middleware passes all requests that do not start with
/newrelic.

Here's an example entry for Developer Mode in a +config.ru+ file:

    require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode'
    use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode

== Production Mode

When your application runs in the production environment, the New
Relic agent runs in production mode. It connects to the New Relic
service and sends deep performance data to the UI for your
analysis. To view this data, log in to http://rpm.newrelic.com.

NOTE: You must have a valid account and license key to view this data
online.  Refer to instructions in *Getting Started*, below.
