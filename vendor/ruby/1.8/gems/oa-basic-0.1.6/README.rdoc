= OmniAuth::Basic

OmniAuth stratgies for APIs that have HTTP Basic authentication (such as Campfire and Basecamp).

== Installation

To get just HTTP Basic functionality:

    gem install oa-basic
    
For the full auth suite:

    gem install omniauth
    
== Stand-Alone Example

Use the strategy as a middleware in your application:

    require 'omniauth/basic'
    
    use OmniAuth::Strategies::Campfire
    
Then simply direct users to '/auth/campfire' to prompt them for their Campfire credentials. You may also pre-set the credentials by POSTing to the URL with appropriate parameters (in the case of Campfire and Basecamp, the parameters are <tt>subdomain</tt>, <tt>user</tt>, and <tt>password</tt>).

== OmniAuth Builder

If you want to allow multiple providers, use the OmniAuth Builder:

    require 'omniauth/basic'
    
    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :campfire
      provider :basecamp
    end
