= OmniAuth::Enterprise

OmniAuth strategies for use in your intranet.

== Installation

To get just enterprise functionality:

    gem install oa-enterprise
    
For the full auth suite:

    gem install omniauth

CAS strategy    
== Stand-Alone Example

Use the strategy as a middleware in your application:

    require 'omniauth/enterprise'
    
    use OmniAuth::Strategies::CAS, :server => 'http://cas.mycompany.com/cas'
    
Then simply direct users to '/auth/cas' to have them sign in via your company's CAS server.
See OmniAuth::Strategies::CAS::Configuration for more configuration options.
    
Then simply direct users to '/auth/cas' to have them sign in via your company's CAS server.
See OmniAuth::Strategies::CAS::Configuration for more configuration options.

== OmniAuth Builder

If CAS is one of several authentication strategies, use the OmniAuth Builder:

    require 'omniauth/enterprise'
    require 'omniauth/oauth'  # for Campfire
    require 'openid/store/filesystem'
    
    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :cas, :server => 'http://cas.mycompany.com/cas'
      provider :campfire
    end

LDAP strategy

    use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP, :host => '10.101.10.1', :port => 389, :method => :plain, :base => 'dc=intridea, dc=com', :uid => 'sAMAccountName', :try_sasl => true, :sasl_mechanisms => "GSS-SPNEGO"
		or
    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :LDAP, :host => '10.101.10.1', :port => 389, :method => :plain, :base => 'dc=intridea, dc=com', :uid => 'sAMAccountName', :try_sasl => true, :sasl_mechanisms => "GSS-SPNEGO"
    end
		    
    LDAP server's :host and :port are required, :method is also a required field, and allowed values are :plain, :ssl, and :tls.
    :base is required, it is the distinguish name (DN) for your organization, all users should be searchable under this base.
    :uid is required, it is the LDAP attribute name for the user name in the login form. typically AD would be 'sAMAccountName' or 'UniquePersonalIdentifier', while 
    OpenLDAP is 'uid'. You can also use 'dn', if your user choose the put in the dn in the login form (but usually is too long for user to remember or know).
    :try_sasl and :sasl_mechanisms are optional, use it to initial SASL connection to server. mechanism supported are DIGEST-MD5 and GSS-SPNEGO.

Then simply direct users to '/auth/ldap' to have them authenticated via your company's LDAP server.
