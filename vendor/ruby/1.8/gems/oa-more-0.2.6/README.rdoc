= OmniAuth::More

OmniAuth stratgies for authentication providers that do not
fit into one of the other authentication gems.

== Installation

To install omniauth as a suite of gems:

    gem install omniauth

To install just the providers in the "more" gem:

    gem install oa-more

== OmniAuth Builder

If you want to allow multiple providers, use the OmniAuth Builder:

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
        provider :flickr, 'api_key', 'secret_key', :scope => 'read'
    end
