= Ruby OAuth

== What

This is a RubyGem for implementing both OAuth clients and servers in Ruby applications.

See the OAuth specs http://oauth.net/core/1.0/

== Installing

  sudo gem install oauth

The source code is now hosted on the OAuth GitHub Project http://github.com/oauth/oauth-ruby

== The basics

This is a ruby library which is intended to be used in creating Ruby Consumer and Service Provider applications. It is NOT a Rails plugin, but could easily be used for the foundation for such a Rails plugin.

As a matter of fact it has been pulled out from an OAuth Rails Plugin http://code.google.com/p/oauth-plugin/ which now requires this GEM.

== Demonstration of usage

We need to specify the oauth_callback url explicitly, otherwise it defaults to "oob" (Out of Band)

  @callback_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/oauth/callback"

Create a new consumer instance by passing it a configuration hash:

  @consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new("key","secret", :site => "https://agree2")

Start the process by requesting a token

  @request_token = @consumer.get_request_token(:oauth_callback => @callback_url)
  session[:request_token] = @request_token
  redirect_to @request_token.authorize_url(:oauth_callback => @callback_url)

When user returns create an access_token

  @access_token = @request_token.get_access_token
  @photos = @access_token.get('/photos.xml')

Now that you have an access token, you can use Typhoeus to interact with the OAuth provider if you choose.

  require 'oauth/request_proxy/typhoeus_request'
  oauth_params = {:consumer => oauth_consumer, :token => access_token}
  hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new
  req = Typhoeus::Request.new(uri, options) 
  oauth_helper = OAuth::Client::Helper.new(req, oauth_params.merge(:request_uri => uri))
  req.headers.merge!({"Authorization" => oauth_helper.header}) # Signs the request
  hydra.queue(req)
  hydra.run
  @response = req.response
