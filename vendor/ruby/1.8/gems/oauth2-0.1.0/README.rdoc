= OAuth2

A Ruby wrapper for the OAuth 2.0 specification. This is a work in progress, being built first to solve the pragmatic process of connecting to existing OAuth 2.0 endpoints (a.k.a. Facebook) with the goal of building it up to meet the entire specification over time.

== Installation

    gem install oauth2

== Web Server Example (Sinatra)

Below is a fully functional example of a Sinatra application that would authenticate to Facebook utilizing the OAuth 2.0 web server flow.

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'oauth2'
    require 'json'

    def client
      OAuth2::Client.new('app_id', 'app_secret', :site => 'https://graph.facebook.com')
    end

    get '/auth/facebook' do
      redirect client.web_server.authorize_url(
        :redirect_uri => redirect_uri, 
        :scope => 'email,offline_access'
      )
    end

    get '/auth/facebook/callback' do
      access_token = client.web_server.get_access_token(params[:code], :redirect_uri => redirect_uri)
      user = JSON.parse(access_token.get('/me'))

      user.inspect
    end

    def redirect_uri
      uri = URI.parse(request.url)
      uri.path = '/auth/facebook/callback'
      uri.query = nil
      uri.to_s
    end
    
That's all there is to it! You can use the access token like you would with the 
OAuth gem, calling HTTP verbs on it etc. You can view more examples on the OAuth2 
Wiki (http://wiki.github.com/intridea/oauth2/examples)
    
== JSON Parsing

Because JSON has become the standard format of the OAuth 2.0 specification,
the <tt>oauth2</tt> gem contains a mode that will perform automatic parsing
of JSON response bodies, returning a hash instead of a string. To enable this
mode, simply add the <tt>:parse_json</tt> option to your client initialization:

    client = OAuth2::Client.new('app_id', 'app_secret', 
      :site => 'https://example.com', 
      :parse_json => true
    )
    
    # Obtain an access token using the client
    token.get('/some/url.json') # {"some" => "hash"}

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
