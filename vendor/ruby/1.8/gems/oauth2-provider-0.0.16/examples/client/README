This is a (very very) simple OAuth2 client, designed to work with the oauth2-provider examples.  To get it running, cd to the client folder, then run:

1) bundle install
2) bundle exec rackup

This should start the client on port 9292

Assuming an example server is running (such as the one in examples/rails3-example), visit http://localhost:9292.  To read content from the server you'll be asked to login (tomafro/secret) and then authorize the client.  Finally some very simple content from the server will be shown.
