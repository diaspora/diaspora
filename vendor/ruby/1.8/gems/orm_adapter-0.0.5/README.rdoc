= ORM Adapter

Provides a single point of entry for popular ruby ORMs.  Its target audience is gem authors who want to support more than one ORM.


== Example of use

  require 'orm_adapter'

  User # is it an ActiveRecord, DM Resource, MongoMapper or MongoId Document?
  
  User.to_adapter.find_first :name => 'Fred' # we don't care!
  
  user_model = User.to_adapter
  user_model.get!(1)                      # find a record by id
  user_model.find_first(:name => 'fred')  # find first fred
  user_model.find_all(:name => 'fred')    # find all freds
  user_model.find_all(:order => :name)    # find all freds, ordered by name
  user_model.create!(:name => 'fred')     # create a fred 

@see OrmAdapter::Base for more details of the supported API
  
== Supported ORMs

Currently supported ORMs are *ActiveRecord*, *DataMapper*, *MongoMapper*, and *MongoId*.

We welcome you to write new adapters as gems. ORM Adapter will stay focused in having these major ORMs working.

To write an adapter look at <tt>lib/orm_adapter/adapters/active_record.rb</tt> for an example of implementation.  To see how to test it, look at <tt>spec/orm_adapter/example_app_shared.rb</tt>, <tt>spec/orm_adapter/adapters/active_record_spec.rb</tt>.  You'll need to require the target ORM in <tt>spec/spec_helper.rb</tt>


== Goals

ORM Adapter goal is to support a minimum API used by most of the plugins that needs agnosticism beyond Active Model.

ORM Adapter will support only basic methods, as +get+, +find_first+, <tt>create!</tt> and so forth. It is not ORM Adapter's goal to support different query constructions, handle table joins, etc.

If you need complex queries, we recommend you to subclass ORM Adapters in your plugin and extend it expressing these query conditions as part of your domain logic.

== History

orm_adapter is an extraction from {pickle}[http://github.com/ianwhite/pickle] by {Ian White}[http://github.com/ianwhite].  Pickle's orm adapter included work by {Daniel Neighman}[http://github.com/hassox], {Josh Bassett}[http://github.com/nullobject], {Marc Lee}[http://github.com/maleko], and {Sebastian Zuchmanski}[http://github.com/sebcioz].

{José Valim}[http://github.com/josevalim] suggested the extraction, and worked on the first release with Ian.

{Luke Cunningham}[http://github.com/icaruswings] contributes the Mongo Mapper adapter.
