module Rack

  # High performant source reloader
  #
  # This class acts as Rack middleware.
  #
  # What makes it especially suited for use in a production environment is that
  # any file will only be checked once and there will only be made one system
  # call stat(2).
  #
  # Please note that this will not reload files in the background, it does so
  # only when actively called.
  #
  # It is performing a check/reload cycle at the start of every request, but
  # also respects a cool down time, during which nothing will be done.
