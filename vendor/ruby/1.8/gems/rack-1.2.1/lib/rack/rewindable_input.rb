  # Class which can make any IO object rewindable, including non-rewindable ones. It does
  # this by buffering the data into a tempfile, which is rewindable.
  #
  # rack.input is required to be rewindable, so if your input stream IO is non-rewindable
  # by nature (e.g. a pipe or a socket) then you can wrap it in an object of this class
  # to easily make it rewindable.
  #
  # Don't forget to call #close when you're done. This frees up temporary resources that
  # RewindableInput uses, though it does *not* close the original IO object.
