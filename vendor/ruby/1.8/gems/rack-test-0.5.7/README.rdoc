= Rack::Test

- Code: http://github.com/brynary/rack-test
- Build: http://runcoderun.com/brynary/rack-test

== Description

Rack::Test is a small, simple testing API for Rack apps. It can be used on its
own or as a reusable starting point for Web frameworks and testing libraries
to build on. Most of its initial functionality is an extraction of Merb 1.0's
request helpers feature.

== Features

* Maintains a cookie jar across requests
* Easily follow redirects when desired
* Set request headers to be used by all subsequent requests
* Small footprint. Approximately 200 LOC

== Example

  require "rack/test"

  class HomepageTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    include Rack::Test::Methods

    def app
      MyApp.new
    end

    def test_redirect_logged_in_users_to_dashboard
      authorize "bryan", "secret"
      get "/"
      follow_redirect!

      assert_equal "http://example.org/redirected", last_request.url
      assert last_response.ok?
    end

  end

== Install
