Description:
    Stubs out a new helper. Pass the helper name, either CamelCased
    or under_scored.

    To create a helper within a module, specify the helper name as a
    path like 'parent_module/helper_name'.

    This generates a helper class in app/helpers and invokes the configured
    test framework.

Example:
    `rails generate helper CreditCard`

    Credit card helper.
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_card_helper.rb
        Test:       test/unit/helpers/credit_card_helper_test.rb
