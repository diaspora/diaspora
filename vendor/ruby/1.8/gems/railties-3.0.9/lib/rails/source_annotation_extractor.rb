# Annotation objects are triplets <tt>:line</tt>, <tt>:tag</tt>, <tt>:text</tt> that
# represent the line where the annotation lives, its tag, and its text. Note
# the filename is not stored.
#
# Annotations are looked for in comments and modulus whitespace they have to
# start with the tag optionally followed by a colon. Everything up to the end
# of the line (or closing ERb comment tag) is considered to be their text.
