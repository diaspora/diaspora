=== 2.2.1 / 2008-09-24
This version provides some minor fixes and enhancements to 2.2.0 intended
to polish RDoc for Ruby 1.9.1.

* 3 Minor Enhancements
  * Support for parsing RDoc from SWIG.  Ruby patch #10742 by Gonzalo
    Garramuno, #13993 by Steven Jenkins.
  * Simple support for Perl POD documentation.  Patch by Hugh Sasse.
  * Changed the default character set of RDoc's output from iso-8859-1 to
    utf-8.

* 9 Bug Fixes
  * Explicitly set the html template's text color, so that the generated
    documentation will display correctly on browsers with custom text and
    background color settings (patch by Luther Thompson).
  * Ensure that RDoc correctly will associate an alias and a method, even
    if it encounters the alias first because the alias lives in a different
    file.
  * Fix the parsing of multiline constants (patch by Chris Alfeld and
    Joel VanderWerf)
  * Make --exclude usuable.  Ruby patch #11671 by Trans.
  * Detect inline C functions.  Ruby Bug #11993 by Florian Frank.
  * Fix an issue in which RDoc might not document a class'
    superclass correctly if the class was defined in multiple files and
    depending on the order in which RDoc processed the files.  This should
    ensure that the child class -> parent class relationship is correct in
    ri documentation, allowing ri to lookup inherited methods (i.e., File.read).
  * Stop ri from crashing when it looks for a completely bogus method (i.e.,
    File#reada).  Now, ri exits with a helpful error message.
  * Fixed missing display of constant values in ri.
  * Fixed display of constants in ri's html output.

=== 2.2.0 / 2008-09-19
This version includes some significant enhancements to ri.  See RI.txt for
documentation about ri.

* 5 Major Enhancements
  * More extensive unit tests (special thanks to Chris Lowis for contributing
    a test).
  * Made ri twice as fast for the most common use case of displaying
    information for a class or a fully-qualified method
    (i.e., ri Array#flatten, after ri has created a cache the first time that
    it runs).
  * Made ri many times faster when searching for an unqualified method (i.e.,
    ri read, again after the first such search has populated ri's cache)
  * Changed ri to do regular expression searches for unqualified methods;
    now, a regular expression for a method can be passed to ri on the
    command-line.
  * Added an interactive mode to ri (patch by Daniel Choi).  Now, when ri
    is given a -i argument, it will allow the user to disambiguate
    unqualified methods if more than one is present and also will allow a
    user to get information for a class' method.

* 8 Minor Enhancements
  * RDoc now adds the package title to the web pages that it generates
    for files and classes/modules, which helps them appear better in
    search engine results.
  * RDoc now automatically generates cross-reference links for classes and
    methods specified relative to the global namespace (i.e., ::A::B::C#method).
  * All built-in templates now output valid, strict XHTML.
  * The documentation is slightly better organized (the markup details were
    merged into the RDoc module's documentation).
  * Improved rdoc's HTML generation speed by about 20% (on Windows, the
    boost seems larger).
  * Provided an ri command-line option to control its caching behavior.
  * Improved RDoc's documentation.  Added RI.txt to document ri.
  * Allow HTML templates distributed as gems to be loaded with the -T option,
    just like the standard templates in rdoc/generator/html (so an HTML
    template lib/new_template.rb in a gem can be used with rdoc -T new_template)

* 25 Bug fixes:
  * Fixed prototype detection in C parser.  Can process ruby 1.8 C files
    again.
  * Fixed the main page for frameless template.  Patch by Marcin Raczkowski.
  * Fixed the main page for frame templates.  Now, if no main page is
    specified, RDoc will default to the README.
  * Fixed missing stylesheet in generated chm.  Patch by Gordon Thiesfeld.
  * Fixed the parsing of module names starting with '::'.  Patch by
    Giuseppe Bilotta.
  * Fixed a case where RDoc first would encounter Foo::Bar and then would
    encounter class Foo.  Previously, RDoc erroneously would have considered
    that both a Foo class and a Foo module existed.
  * Fix a clase where RDoc would not generate correct cross-reference links
    to a class contained within a module of the same name (i.e. RDoc::RDoc)
  * Prevented RDoc from trying to parse binary files, which would produce
    garbage output.
  * RDoc now correctly converts ' characters to apostrophes, opening single
    quotes, and closing single quotes in most cases (smart single quotes).
  * RDoc now correctly converts " characters to opening double quotes and
    and closing double quotes in most cases (smart double quotes).
  * (c) correctly is converted into the copyright symbol.
  * '&' characters in text now correctly are translated to HTML character codes.
  * Fixed missing stylesheet in generated chm.  Patch by Gordon Thiesfeld.
  * Fixed broken method links in the built-in templates.
  * RDoc properly links to files and classes in the one page HTML template.
  * The kilmer and hefss templates properly syntax highlight when inlining
    source code.
  * The kilmer and hefss template class pages properly display methods again.
  * Fixed broken class, file, and method links in the frameless template.
  * Fixed the clipping of source code in the html and frameless templates when
    the source code cannot fit into the window; a scrollbar now will allow
    all of the source code to be viewed.
  * Fixed the missing constant descriptions in the html and frameless
    templates.
  * Fixed the ri command-line options that customize the directories to be
    searched for documentation.
  * Fixed the XML generator.  Patch by Anthony Durity.
  * Stopped the XML template from generating invalid XML due to malformed
    embedded ruby.
  * Adding missing information about a class' constants to the XML template.
  * Fixed the horizontal rule markup (---) so that it correctly adds a
    horizontal rule rather than suppressing all text that follows.

=== 2.1.0 / 2008-07-20

* 3 Major Enhancements:
  * RDoc now knows about meta-programmed methods, see RDoc::Parser::Ruby
  * Reorganized parsers under RDoc::Parser base class
  * ri now walks the ancestors of a class looking for a method e.g. ri
    File#read displays documentation for IO#read (may require regeneration of
    ri data)
* 5 Minor Enhancements:
  * Allow links to files
  * Default options now taken from RDOCOPT environment variable
  * Class method documentation can be found at toplevel now (def X.foo)
  * Allow HTML templates distributed as gems to be loaded with the -T option,
    just like the standard templates in rdoc/generator/html (so an HTML
    template lib/new_template.rb in a gem can be used with rdoc -T new_template)
  * `rdoc -v` prints out files, classes, modules and methods as it goes
* 11 Bug Fixes:
  * `ri Foo.bar` now looks for class methods also
  * Sections work in the default template again
  * Doesn't warn about :foo:: list item being an unrecognized directive
  * RDoc no longer converts characters inside tt tags
  * Fixed "unitialized constant RDoc::Markup::ToHtml::HTML"
  * Fixed generation of relative links
  * Fixed various diagram generation issues
  * Fixed templates broken by switch to erb
  * Fixed issue with <!-- --> style comments
  * Lowercase words are no longer rdoc'd as methods without leading #, as
    described in the documentation
  * RDoc now correctly sets superclasses if they were originally unknown

=== 2.0.0 / 2008-04-10

* 3 Major Enhancements:
  * Renamespaced everything RDoc under the RDoc module.
  * New `ri` implementation.
    * Reads from a cache in ~/.ri/ for enhanced speed.
    * RubyGems aware, only searches latest gem versions.
  * Now up to over 100 tests and 200 assertions.
* 4 Minor Enhancements:
  * Switched to an ERb-based TemplatePage, see RDoc::TemplatePage.
  * Class/module ri now displays attribute and constant comments.
  * Cross-references can be disabled with a leading \.
  * Relaxed parsing for some RDoc inline markup.
