rspec-core provides the structure for RSpec code examples:

    describe Account do
      it "has a balance of zero when first opened" do
        # example code goes here - for more on the 
        # code inside the examples, see rspec-expectations 
        # and rspec-mocks
      end
    end

## Issues

The documentation for rspec-core is a work in progress. We'll be adding
Cucumber features over time, and clarifying existing ones.  If you have
specific features you'd like to see added, find the existing documentation
incomplete or confusing, or, better yet, wish to write a missing Cucumber
feature yourself, please [submit an
issue](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues) or a [pull
request](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core).
