### 2.6.0 / 2011-05-12

[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0)

* Enhancements
  * `shared_context` (Damian Nurzynski)
      * extend groups matching specific metadata with:
          * method definitions
          * subject declarations
          * let/let! declarations
          * etc (anything you can do in a group)
  * `its([:key])` works for any subject with #[]. (Peter Jaros)
  * `treat_symbols_as_metadata_keys_with_true_values` (Myron Marston)
  * Print a deprecation warning when you configure RSpec after defining
    an example.  All configuration should happen before any examples are
    defined. (Myron Marston)
  * Pass the exit status of a DRb run to the invoking process. This causes
    specs run via DRb to not just return true or false. (Ilkka Laukkanen)
  * Refactoring of `ConfigurationOptions#parse_options` (Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas)
  * Report excluded filters in runner output (tip from andyl)
  * Clean up messages for filters/tags.
  * Restore --pattern/-P command line option from rspec-1
  * Support false as well as true in config.full_backtrace= (Andreas Tolf Tolfsen)

* Bug fixes
  * Don't stumble over an exception without a message (Hans Hasselberg)
  * Remove non-ascii characters from comments that were choking rcov (Geoffrey
    Byers)
  * Fixed backtrace so it doesn't include lines from before the autorun at_exit
    hook (Myron Marston)
  * Include RSpec::Matchers when first example group is defined, rather
    than just before running the examples.  This works around an obscure
    bug in ruby 1.9 that can cause infinite recursion. (Myron Marston)
  * Don't send `example_group_[started|finished]` to formatters for empty groups.
  * Get specs passing on jruby (Sidu Ponnappa)
  * Fix bug where mixing nested groups and outer-level examples gave
    unpredictable :line_number behavior (Artur MaÅ‚ecki)
  * Regexp.escape the argument to --example (tip from Elliot Winkler)
  * Correctly pass/fail pending block with message expectations
  * CommandLine returns exit status (0/1) instead of true/false
  * Create path to formatter output file if it doesn't exist (marekj).


### 2.5.1 / 2011-02-06

[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1)

NOTE: this release breaks compatibility with rspec/autotest/bundler
integration, but does so in order to greatly simplify it.

With this release, if you want the generated autotest command to include
'bundle exec', require Autotest's bundler plugin in a .autotest file in the
project's root directory or in your home directory:

    require "autotest/bundler"

Now you can just type 'autotest' on the commmand line and it will work as you expect.

If you don't want 'bundle exec', there is nothing you have to do.
