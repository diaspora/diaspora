Feature: shared examples

  Shared examples let you describe behaviour of types or modules. When
  declared, a shared group's content is stored. It is only realized in the
  context of another example group, which provides any context the shared group
  needs to run.

  A shared group is included in another group using any of:
  
      include_examples "name"      # include the examples in the current context

      it_behaves_like "name"       # include the examples in a nested context
      it_should_behave_like "name" # include the examples in a nested context
