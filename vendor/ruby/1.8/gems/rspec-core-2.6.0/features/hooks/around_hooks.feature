Feature: around hooks

  Around hooks receive the example as a block argument, extended to behave like
  a proc.  This lets you define code that should be executed before and after
  the example. Of course, you can do the same thing with before and after hooks,
  and it's often cleaner to do so.

  Where around hooks shine is when you want to run an example in a block. For
  example, if your database library offers a transaction method that receives
  a block, you can use an around hook as described in the first scenario:

  WARNING: around hooks do not share state with the example the way before and
  after hooks do. This means that you can not share instance variables between
  around hooks and examples.

  Also, mock frameworks are set up and torn down within the context of running
  the example, so you can not interact with them directly in around hooks.
