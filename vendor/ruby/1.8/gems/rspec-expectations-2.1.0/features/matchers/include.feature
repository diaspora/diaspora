Feature: include matcher

  Use the include matcher to specify that a collection includes one or more
  expected objects.  This works on any object that responds to #include?  (such
  as a string or array):

    "a string".should include("a")
    "a string".should include("str")
    "a string".should include("str", "g")
    "a string".should_not include("foo")

    [1, 2].should include(1)
    [1, 2].should include(1, 2)
    [1, 2].should_not include(17)

  The matcher also provides flexible handling for hashes:

    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should include(:a)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should include(:a, :b)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should include(:a => 1)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should include(:b => 2, :a => 1)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should_not include(:c)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should_not include(:a => 2)
    {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should_not include(:c => 3)
