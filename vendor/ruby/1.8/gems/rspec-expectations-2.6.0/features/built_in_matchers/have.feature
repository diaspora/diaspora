Feature: have(n).items matcher

  RSpec provides several matchers that make it easy to set expectations about the
  size of a collection.  There are three basic forms:

    * collection.should have(x).items
    * collection.should have_at_least(x).items
    * collection.should have_at_most(x).items

  In addition, #have_exactly is provided as an alias to #have.

  These work on any collection-like object--the object just needs to respond to #size
  or #length (or both).  When the matcher is called directly on a collection object,
  the #items call is pure syntactic sugar.  You can use anything you want here.  These
  are equivalent:

    * collection.should have(x).items
    * collection.should have(x).things

  You can also use this matcher on a non-collection object that returns a collection
  from one of its methods.  For example, Dir#entries returns an array, so you could
  set an expectation using the following:

    Dir.new("my/directory").should have(7).entries
