Isn't life confusing enough?
Instead of having to figure out the meaning of this:
  should_not have_at_most(#{@expected}).#{@collection_name}
We recommend that you use this instead:

    # number of items OR if the receiver OWNS a collection
    # with the submitted number of items.
    #
    # If the receiver OWNS the collection, you must use the name
    # of the collection. So if a <tt>Team</tt> instance has a
    # collection named <tt>#players</tt>, you must use that name
    # to set the expectation.
    #
    # If the receiver IS the collection, you can use any name
    # you like for <tt>named_collection</tt>. We'd recommend using
    # either "elements", "members", or "items" as these are all
    # standard ways of describing the things IN a collection.
    #
    # This also works for Strings, letting you set an expectation
    # about its length

    #

    #   # Passes if [1,2,3].length == 3
