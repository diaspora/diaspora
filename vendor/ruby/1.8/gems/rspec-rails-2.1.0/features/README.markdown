rspec-rails extends Rails' built-in testing framework to support rspec examples
for requests, controllers, models, views, and helpers.

## Rails-3

rspec-rails-2 supports rails-3.0.0 and later. For earlier versions of Rails,
you need [rspec-rails-1.3](http://rspec.info).

## Issues

The documentation for rspec-rails is a work in progress. We'll be adding
Cucumber features over time, and clarifying existing ones.  If you have
specific features you'd like to see added, find the existing documentation
incomplete or confusing, or, better yet, wish to write a missing Cucumber
feature yourself, please [submit an
issue](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues) or a [pull
request](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).
