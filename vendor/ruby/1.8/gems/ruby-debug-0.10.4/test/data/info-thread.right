List info about thread NUM.

If no thread number is given, we list info for all threads. 'terse' and 'verbose' 
options are possible. If terse, just give summary thread name information. See 
"help info threads" for more detail about this summary information.

If 'verbose' appended to the end of the command, then the entire
stack trace is given for each thread.
# help info threads
information of currently-known threads.

This information includes whether the thread is current (+), if it is
suspended ($), or ignored (!).  The thread number and the top stack
item. If 'verbose' is given then the entire stack frame is shown.
