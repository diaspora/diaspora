2010-10-15 14:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Go over documentation (1st pass)
	  including that created by rdoc.
	  Better instructions for how to build on MS Windows and the
	  include
	  cross-compile.sh script I use.
	  Update rubyforge URL's used to building ChangeLogs.

2010-10-14 01:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: improve list and list - (backwards) handling when
	  hitting end of file.

2010-09-20 11:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: "rake test" of ruby-debug gem should now work without
	  requiring or using ruby-debug-base code. Rubyforge tracker
	  #28560.

2010-09-20 09:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Make sure version file is closed. Thanks to Mamoru
	  Tasaka. Tracker #28581.

2010-09-15 16:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Rakefile: make rake --prereqs work if only
	  ruby-debug.tar.gz is used. Add
	  test/config.yml to gem. See tracker #28560.
	  ruby_debug.c: 10.0.4.rc2 now

2010-09-12 01:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: pm.rb: spelling mistake

2010-08-13 05:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add Debugger.inside_emacs? Environment variable EMACS
	  for inside Emacs is deprecated in favor of INSIDE_EMACS.
	  Rubyforge #28465.

2010-08-02 12:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Go over installation instructions for Emacs.
	  Add a basic files, README, INSTALL and AUTHORS.
	  Change version from 0.10.4vc to 0.10.4rc1

2010-05-06 21:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: More explicit about incomplete saved frames. Now
	  reads:
	  Warning: saved frames may be incomplete;
	  compare debugger backtrace (bt) with Ruby caller(0).

2010-04-18 07:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Fix bug in "reload" command. tracker #26130

2010-03-21 23:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add ability to start remote debugging on random ports
	  and to query those ports. Tracker #27889 from Hongli Lai.

2010-03-16 04:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix for what looks like an optimization bug on 64-bit
	  gcc systems with optimization. The Symptom is that debugger
	  "catch" causes the program to immediately terminate when the Ruby
	  exception is raised. Possibly a problem in using
	  INT2FIX(FIX2INT...)..) and/or possibly a bug in those macros.

2010-03-12 20:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: irb.rb: Goodness backported from rbdbgr. Add IRB 'q'
	  for quit and ability to
	  run debugger commands from inside irb via dbgr, e.g. >> dbgr
	  'where'
	  
	  kill.rb: remove spurious debug output
	  
	  Rakefile: add install targets (backport from rbdbgr)

2009-11-28 22:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix problem caused by gdb-ui renamed to gdb-mi.
	  Rubyforge tracker #27152
	  Remove all Emacs byte compile warning messages.
	  
	  Note however all of this code will eventually be phased out in
	  favor
	  of emacs-dbgr (on github).

2009-04-04 14:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Make test-save less installation-specific

2009-03-29 03:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Canonicalize breakpoint locations a little better.
	  More work should be done and more work should be done on the
	  testing side too.

2009-03-11 23:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: update texinfo for catch

2008-11-25 02:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Frame without a frame number means frame 0, same as
	  gdb. We are now in 0.10.4 territory now.

2008-11-16 00:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add rdoc for rdebug script.

2008-11-14 19:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Go over documentation and revise.

2008-11-14 15:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Move Debugger#debugger from base
	  to cli. Revert code in ruby_debug.c and block parameter in
	  debugger. cf. -> Compare with. Document Debugger.start better.

2008-11-13 10:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Make Debugger.start{block} work if Debugger.started?
	  is false. Second try.

2008-11-11 02:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Tweak truncated stack test since Ruby's caller doesn't
	  seem to include (tail?) recursive calls and we do. Get regression
	  tests working in light of recent changes.

2008-11-10 01:48  Kent Sibilev

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: a little bit more readable

2008-11-10 01:35  Kent Sibilev

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Debugger.start must always call the passed
	  block

2008-11-07 19:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Change truncated frame message.

2008-11-07 10:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add check to "where" to see if the call stack is
	  truncated; task #2354

2008-11-06 16:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: #22698 Allow ruby-debug-base 0.x.y.z be compatible
	  with ruby-debug 0.x.y.

2008-11-02 21:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Debugger.start with a block now
	  stops inside the block. Debugger.debugger with a block works like
	  Debugger.start with a block.
	  
	  The whole interface is hopelessly kludgy and needs to be redone.

2008-10-26 14:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Doc typo. Add comment to remind me how to turn off
	  optimizationin extconf.rb

2008-10-25 16:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Warn and add a "confirmation" when setting a
	  breakpoint on a file that is not loaded. Regression tests no
	  longer fail.

2008-09-22 00:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: #22118 bug in showing variables post mortem.
	  Patch thanks to rubikitch.
	  Update pm.rb integration test.

2008-09-03 17:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Show line numbers when $DEBUG is set. Patch #21772
	  from Martin Krauskopf

2008-07-07 07:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Tracker [#20041] start erroneously moved to
	  Kernel - should be in
	  Debugger.start

2008-06-20 06:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: trace.rb: add "trace var"
	  ruby-debug-base.rb: remove another undefined warning.

2008-05-24 01:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Remove dup lines.

2008-05-15 16:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Handle "catch nnn off" Forgotten there during r656.
	  From mkrauskopf [#20156].

2008-05-05 18:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: make test-frame installation independent. Bug #19931

2008-04-29 13:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Test line number in "continue" command for validity.

2008-04-28 16:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: From Martin Krauskopf via patch #19779
	  
	  Allow folks to configure Ruby used for CLI tests in the
	  test/config.yaml. The defaults are for native Ruby, so nothing
	  needs
	  to be done for ruby-debug.
	  
	  Developers of interfaces other than cli might override
	  config.yaml by
	  customized config.private.yaml which is ignored. So there will be
	  no
	  trash in e.g. 'svn st' output when developer customize the Ruby
	  to be
	  used.
	  
	  Handy for alternative interface implementations using
	  svn:externals.

2008-04-22 02:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Experiment with debugger(steps=0). Puts us in
	  the debugger call, but this may be the best we can do for now.
	  See tracker
	  #19639.

2008-04-16 01:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: In 0.10.2 now. Some work to cope systems without
	  readline. More work is needed.
	  Add test of "set autoeval." Undefined command message more
	  closely like gdb's.

2008-04-10 08:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: linecache is required by ruby-debug-base not
	  ruby-debug. Thanks Martin!

2008-04-10 08:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Last change before 0.10.1 release.

2008-04-10 02:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Cosmetic stuff: spelling corrections. Update node
	  structure so texinfo
	  doesn't complain.

2008-04-08 14:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: autorequire is deprecated and presumably no longer
	  needed
	  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/182827

2008-04-07 00:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: ruby-debug-base.rb: document
	  Debugger.start parameters.
	  CHANGES: Revise what's happened
	  test-shortkey.el: A failing regression test because I think
	  rdebug-shortkey-mode
	  is not correct.

2008-04-03 19:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Allow setting :post_mortem => true
	  from Debugger.start.

2008-03-28 13:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Don't unconditionally turn on short-key mode when
	  annotations are on. Use rdebug-short-key-mode setting to decide.

2008-03-23 17:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: set.rb -> settings.rb since it's already one command
	  per file, and
	  remove another :nodoc.
	  Rakefile: split long line

2008-03-18 16:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix bug in 'list' command when wrapping off the end.
	  test-finish.rb: tolerate buggy in Ruby versions <= 1.8.7.

2008-03-13 02:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: "finish" works like gdb
	  - stop just before the
	  most recent method finishes. Will now accept a number which stops
	  that
	  many frames completed. (Note that return line numbers will be
	  funny,
	  the first line of the method until Ruby 1.8.7.)

2008-03-10 13:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Dunno why we are now one line number less. So be it
	  (for now).

2008-03-09 23:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: For now we require the duplicate numbers on
	  conditionals.

2008-03-02 04:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Better error message for an invalid break
	  command.

2008-02-28 05:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: breakpoints.{cmd,right}: test for an invalid stopping
	  line number
	  rdebug-fns.el: move generic split-string-and-unquote from
	  rdebug-core.
	  rdebug-core.el: Add rdebug-common-init to replace
	  gud-common-init. Is
	  simpler, and finds files better via debugger output/annotations.
	  Fix bug in rdebug-setup-windows: gud-find-file can return nil,
	  and
	  we still need to set buf.

2008-02-27 04:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Slightly more robust handle_post_mortem.

2008-02-26 17:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Go over source location positioning. 0 is now the
	  oldest (first) position. Add M-S-down and M-S-up for first and
	  last. More tests needed in test-fns.el and need to prompt on wrap
	  around.

2008-02-26 00:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix bug in "info file xxx breakpoints".

2008-02-24 16:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: rdebug; make more Ruby 1.9 compatible.

2008-02-24 16:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Minor changes.
	  rdbg.rb: don't need $DEBUG test any more
	  rdebug-regexp.el: go over with checkdoc
	  bin/rdebug: use PATH_SEPARATOR (for 'doze again)

2008-02-24 04:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: CLI: Add long help for "info file".
	  
	  test/test-help.rb: Make test failures easier to fix and more like
	  the
	  other tests.
	  
	  emacs/test: finish testing all of the funcitons in rdebug-fns.el
	  
	  rdebug-layouts.el: Make checkdoc clean.
	  rdebug-track.el: don't need to rename shell buffer. Do it as an
	  option only.
	  rdebug-secondary.el: get rid of hoaky buffer finding for at least
	  gud-comint-buf. (Should probably do others as well)
	  
	  DOC: Note weird line stopping locations. Describe what "ctrl" in
	  prompt means.

2008-02-21 02:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fringe for frame buffer the same as in source code.
	  Move
	  miscellaneous small functions to a new file. Reduce duplication
	  of
	  "chomp" code.

2008-02-19 23:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: rdebug-cmd.el: M-insert toggles shortkey mode in the
	  command buffer
	  rdebug: search for Ruby program if file is not found and no
	  SEPARATOR
	  chars in the filename

2008-02-18 19:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Frame switching shouldn't be recorded in position
	  history ring.

2008-02-17 13:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Add Debugger.last_exception. Show exception
	  in post-mortem when "info program"
	  is issued. Reorganize list of major changes better.

2008-02-13 21:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: processor.rb: spelled "post-mortem" incorrectly in
	  prompt.

2008-02-13 17:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Set up keys for comint-next-prompt and
	  comint-previous-prompt.

2008-02-12 02:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix bug in "info thread verbose" which wasn't showing
	  full traceback.

2008-02-09 15:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: helper.rb Failed attempt to DRY tests more. But save
	  what we have
	  which may someday in the future be used to go further. Minus to
	  undercore in Data file names in preparation such time. (We'll use
	  the
	  filename as the test name).
	  
	  testing

2008-02-06 16:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add 'nowarn to find-file-noselect and test that we
	  don't get a warning.

2008-02-05 01:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: rdebug.el: Add a defgroup for rdebug so customization
	  in Emacs 23 is possible.
	  Some other minor doc fixes.
	  setshow.* make sure we don't have an $Id line that we have to
	  check against.

2008-02-03 15:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Try to get testing a little more organized, although
	  more work should
	  be done: Create a data directory for comparison ("right") and
	  script
	  command ("cmd") files. Code is now more uniform (and should DRY'd
	  a
	  bit more).

2008-02-02 23:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Remove commands in post-mortem which are not
	  applicable, e.g."step",
	  "next", "continue"...
	  
	  "No breakpoints have been set" is now an error message when
	  trying to
	  set a breakpoint.
	  
	  Add post-mortem test.
	  
	  Debug.init no longer exists.

2008-02-02 09:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Remove Debugger.init and fold options
	  parameter into Debugger.start.
	  Old Debugger.start has been renamed Deebugger.start_

2008-01-31 16:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Leave ruby_debug.c this way for now.

2008-01-31 16:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: ruby_debug.c: more adventures in exception handling
	  processor.rb: Removal of crash when annotate is on. Need to fix
	  the source of the
	  problem though.

2008-01-31 15:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Handle post-mortem and exception traceback
	  reporting in ruby-debug

2008-01-30 17:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add Command.find() to find a subcommand name.
	  condition.right: correct for breakpoint hit counts.

2008-01-30 01:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add number of times a breakpoint is hit like gdb does.

2008-01-29 22:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Columnize breakpoint output.

2008-01-29 11:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: More annotate=2 fixes.

2008-01-28 15:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add info file breakpoints to show lines which we can
	  set a breakpoint on.
	  Revise so we chdir into SRC_DIR.
	  test-hist.rb is broken - will fix later.

2008-01-25 12:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Add Debugger.init which intializes
	  things that rdebug does. This
	  allows a restart even though rdebug wasn't called initially.

2008-01-22 23:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Allow "help info xxx". Add ability for long help on
	  "info" command.
	  Add "info break xx".
	  
	  test: remove test/unit class name conflicts. All the tests we
	  wrote
	  now get run.

2008-01-19 19:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Move ruby-debug-base tests to base directory. Add a
	  binding_n regression test.

2008-01-16 18:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Need to present source filename (__FILE__) as Ruby and
	  therefore breakpoint
	  sees it.
	  

2008-01-16 02:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog, ruby-debug-base.rb: Line caching moved to an external
	  gem, linecache. We now require
	  version 0.2 of that or greater.

2008-01-14 01:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Make rdebug-track work better in the face of prompt
	  and error annotations.
	  control.rb: need another test when rdebug not called initially.

2008-01-13 21:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Some stack -> frame renaming
	  ext/breakpoint.c: put methods in alpha order (to help with
	  reference man)
	  breakpoints.rb: one print -> errmsg

2008-01-13 18:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Create errmsg routine for error output, start tagging
	  error messages
	  as errors. Under annotate 3, output errors similar to gdb
	  --annotate
	  does (although still simplified). Have Emacs pick up debugger
	  error
	  annotations.

2008-01-13 04:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Check validity of expressions in breakpoint conditions
	  and don't allow
	  enabling a syntactically invalid expression.
	  
	  Start noting messages which are errors via an errmsg routine.

2008-01-11 10:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Document that ruby-debug resets $0. Align program
	  options in ref manual and --help. Alphabetize better.

2008-01-10 22:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: More correct $0 fix. Deal with the case ./ is
	  automatically added.
	  However this might not be right in all cases.

2008-01-10 22:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Was gobbling arg in processing --emacs. Add test.

2008-01-10 10:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add condition command.

2008-01-09 19:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Rakefile: rdebug.rb -> rdbg.el
	  rdebug-dbg.el: Add $Id$

2008-01-09 19:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Break out secondary buffer into their own file, and
	  also internal
	  debug code and general secondary commands. Secondary buffer code
	  removed from rdebug-cmd and moved into the appropriate file.
	  
	  rdebug-edit-variables-value is not defined so comment out for
	  now.

2008-01-08 16:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Restore $: to the value it was before rdebug call.

2008-01-07 20:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add "var class". This means "var const .." can no
	  longer be abbreviated "var c"; use "var co" instead.
	  (Or "var const" or "var constant"

2008-01-07 19:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add class level variables to "info variables"

2008-01-07 17:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Add "self" to list "info variables" spits out.

2008-01-07 09:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: --emacs sets width to 120. rdebug-core.el will reset
	  to 120 unless it's already that.

2008-01-07 04:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Split out ChangeLogs better (I hope).

2008-01-06 20:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: test/*-emacs-basic*, tdebug: Add test of running in
	  Emacs without annotations.
	  
	  emacs/*.el: make regexp tests work again, move regexp to from
	  core to regexp.
	  Add an annotate regexp test.
	  
	  processor.rb: Remove some anotation print from bleeding into
	  output
	  when annotations are not wanted. Reinstate "Program finished" in
	  annotations and outside (rdebug).

2008-01-06 18:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Create Processor class and subclass that. Perhaps a
	  mixin would be good.
	  Remove annotation output bleanding when annotate is off.
	  Try to reduce the mess annotations is adding to processor.rb
	  rdebug-core.el: fix indentation to pass the regression test
	  Anders added
	  Makefile.am: Add rdebug-source.el to distribution.
	  Make sure "rake test"

2008-01-06 02:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Some work on saving state across a restart. More work
	  is needed on the
	  script command to get this working. The save-file name is now
	  optional. save.rb split off from script.rb Display expressions
	  and
	  some settings are now captured in the save/restore file.
	  Add interface.finalize - things that need to be done before quit
	  or
	  restart.

2008-01-05 21:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: More work to make annotate more like gdb's.
	  starting/stopping/exiting
	  should be more similar. Some code has been commented out until we
	  get
	  the Emacs interface to match. See "FIXME: ANNOTATE" in
	  processor.rb.
	  Also regression tests for output and annotate currently fail for
	  this
	  reason.

2008-01-02 20:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: helper.rb: add regexp for a position. TODO: add
	  parsing routine and use in
	  various commands

2008-01-02 14:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: processor.rb: Redo where starting/exiting annotations
	  are done.
	  rdebug.el: back off on setting output command for now.

2008-01-01 15:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Fix --emacs to do --no-quit properly.

2008-01-01 09:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Remove RDoc warnings caused because C files have been
	  split up.

2008-01-01 05:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: reindent -> indent. Makefile.am: wasn't including all
	  test files.

2007-12-31 06:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Rakefile: add spit-off C files to ruby-debug-base gem.

2007-12-31 06:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: rdebug-test-cmd.el: Indentation

2007-12-31 06:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Changes and more changes.

2007-12-29 13:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Remove looping on quit. "-n" is broken so remove it
	  for now.

2007-12-28 15:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: info.rb: Incorrect test for no display expressions.
	  display.rb: Grammar thing.
	  processor.rb: Slightly cleaner code
	  test/* more/better tests.

2007-12-27 21:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Be more agressive about resetting gud-last-frame and
	  gud-last-last-frame. These foul up tracking when debugging is
	  interrupted.
	  We probably need a special "reset" command.

2007-12-26 18:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Version number games - maybe 0.10.1 is better.

2007-12-25 23:40  Rocky Bernstein

	  toggle command.

2007-12-25 09:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: breakpoints.*: main -> Object. Add bad Class name test
	  AUTHOR: Add Anders
	  README: note ruby-debug-extra. More precise (I think)

2007-12-24 00:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Rakefile: set up gem unit test for ruby-debug-base.
	  Add file in test/
	  so we could do the same for ruby-debug were it not for other
	  mysterious
	  problems.

2007-12-23 17:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* ChangeLog: Go over packaging:
	  ChangeLogs for ruby-debug-base (in ext and lib) separate from CLI
	  ChangeLog
	  ChangeLogs now map userid to names
	  ruby-debug-base regression test included in ruby-debug-base
	  Columnize test separated. (It will disappear when ruby-debug
	  requires it
	  as an external)

2007-12-16 21:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Add "info variables test".
	  
	  ruby-debug-base.rb: Not sure how test(?M, file) ever worked
	  before but change
	  to use File.stat(file).mtime
	  info.rb: ignore debugger variables which are sometimes set.

2007-12-10 03:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: doc changes.

2007-06-26 07:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: Run .rdebugrc on Debugger.start. Look for
	  this in the current directory and run that instead the one in
	  $HOME if that exists. Again, inspired and compatible with gdb.
	  
	  rdebug: Check script for syntax errors before loading. We get
	  more informative errors and it doesn't look like rdebug is at
	  fault.

2007-06-05 16:36  Kent Sibilev

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: code reorganization.
	  reverted 'run' command.

2007-06-05 07:59  Kent Sibilev

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: restore post_mortem

2007-06-02 15:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: lib/ruby-debug-base.rb: add Quit and Restart
	  exceptions which can reliably be used after the delayed exception
	  handling bug is fixed
	  emacs/rdebug-track.el and cli/ruby-debug/processor.rb: more
	  accurate line tracking in EMACS. When not in emacs should be more
	  like what was there.

2007-06-01 21:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: parens around a print seems to give a
	  warning. Remove.

2007-05-23 16:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: post_mortem: to test $! *before* running
	  debug_at_ext or else we may get an erroneous message:
	  ruby-debug-base.rb:162:in `current_context': Debugger.start is
	  not called yet. (RuntimeError)
	  
	  A simple test case to show the problem:
	  
	  "require rubygems"
	  "require ruby-debug"
	  Debugger.start
	  Debugger.post_mortem
	  exit # Causes us to incorrectly give the above error
