= Ruby OpenID Library Installation

== Rubygems Installation

Rubygems is a tool for installing ruby libraries and their
dependancies.  If you have rubygems installed, simply:

  gem install ruby-openid

== Manual Installation

Unpack the archive and run setup.rb to install:

 ruby setup.rb

setup.rb installs the library into your system ruby.  If don't want to
add openid to you system ruby, you may instead add the *lib* directory of
the extracted tarball to your RUBYLIB environment variable:

  $ export RUBYLIB=${RUBYLIB}:/path/to/ruby-openid/lib


== Testing the Installation

Make sure everything installed ok:
 $> irb
 irb$> require "openid"
 => true

Or, if you installed via rubygems:

 $> irb
 irb$> require "rubygems"
 => true
 irb$> require_gem "ruby-openid" 
 => true

== Run the test suite

Go into the test directory and execute the *runtests.rb* script.

== Next steps

* Run consumer.rb in the examples directory. 
* Get started writing your own consumer using OpenID::Consumer
* Write your own server with OpenID::Server
* Use the OpenIDLoginGenerator!  Read example/README for more info.
