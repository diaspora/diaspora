* Supports multiple storage mechanisms (Filesystem, ActiveRecord, Memory)
* Example code to help you get started, including:
  * Ruby on Rails based consumer and server
  * OpenIDLoginGenerator for quickly getting creating a rails app that uses
    OpenID for authentication
  * ActiveRecordOpenIDStore plugin
* Comprehensive test suite
* Supports both OpenID 1 and OpenID 2 transparently

==Installing
Before running the examples or writing your own code you'll need to install
the library.  See the INSTALL file or use rubygems:

  gem install ruby-openid
  
Check the installation:
  
  $ irb
  irb> require 'rubygems'
  irb> require_gem 'ruby-openid'
  => true

The library is known to work with Ruby 1.8.4 on Unix, Max OSX and
Win32.  Examples have been tested with Rails 1.1 and 1.2, and 2.0.

==Getting Started
The best way to start is to look at the rails_openid example.
You can run it with:
 cd examples/rails_openid
 script/server

If you are writing an OpenID Relying Party, a good place to start is:
examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/consumer_controller.rb

And if you are writing an OpenID provider:
examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/server_controller.rb

The library code is quite well documented, so don't be squeamish, and
look at the library itself if there's anything you don't understand in
the examples.
