This directory contains several examples that demonstrate use of the
OpenID library.  Make sure you have properly installed the library
before running the examples.  These examples are a great place to
start in integrating OpenID into your application.

==Rails example

The rails_openid contains a fully functional OpenID server and relying
party, and acts as a starting point for implementing your own
production rails server.  You'll need the latest version of Ruby on
Rails installed, and then:

 cd rails_openid
 ./script/server

Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000/ and follow the instructions.

The relevant code to work from when writing your Rails OpenID Relying
Party is: 
  rails_openid/app/controllers/consumer_controller.rb
If you are working on an OpenID provider, check out
  rails_openid/app/controllers/server_controller.rb

Since the library and examples are Apache-licensed, don't be shy about 
copy-and-paste.

==Rails ActiveRecord OpenIDStore plugin

For various reasons you may want or need to deploy your ruby openid
consumer/server using an SQL based store.  The active_record_openid_store 
is a plugin that makes using an SQL based store simple.  Follow the
README inside the plugin's dir for usage.
