module OpenID
  # OpenID support for Relying Parties (aka Consumers).
  #
  # This module documents the main interface with the OpenID consumer
  # library.  The only part of the library which has to be used and
  # isn't documented in full here is the store required to create an
  # Consumer instance.
  #
  # = OVERVIEW
  #
  # The OpenID identity verification process most commonly uses the
  # following steps, as visible to the user of this library:
  #
  # 1. The user enters their OpenID into a field on the consumer's
  #    site, and hits a login button.
  #
  # 2. The consumer site discovers the user's OpenID provider using
  #    the Yadis protocol.
  #
  # 3. The consumer site sends the browser a redirect to the OpenID
  #    provider.  This is the authentication request as described in
  #    the OpenID specification.
  #
  # 4. The OpenID provider's site sends the browser a redirect back to
  #    the consumer site.  This redirect contains the provider's
  #    response to the authentication request.
  #
  # The most important part of the flow to note is the consumer's site
  # must handle two separate HTTP requests in order to perform the
  # full identity check.
  #
  # = LIBRARY DESIGN
  #
  # This consumer library is designed with that flow in mind.  The
  # goal is to make it as easy as possible to perform the above steps
  # securely.
  #
  # At a high level, there are two important parts in the consumer
  # library.  The first important part is this module, which contains
  # the interface to actually use this library.  The second is
  # openid/store/interface.rb, which describes the interface to use if
  # you need to create a custom method for storing the state this
  # library needs to maintain between requests.
  #
  # In general, the second part is less important for users of the
  # library to know about, as several implementations are provided
  # which cover a wide variety of situations in which consumers may
  # use the library.
  #
  # The Consumer class has methods corresponding to the actions
  # necessary in each of steps 2, 3, and 4 described in the overview.
  # Use of this library should be as easy as creating an Consumer
  # instance and calling the methods appropriate for the action the
  # site wants to take.
  #
  # This library automatically detects which version of the OpenID
  # protocol should be used for a transaction and constructs the
  # proper requests and responses.  Users of this library do not need
  # to worry about supporting multiple protocol versions; the library
  # supports them implicitly.  Depending on the version of the
  # protocol in use, the OpenID transaction may be more secure.  See
  # the OpenID specifications for more information.
  #
  # = SESSIONS, STORES, AND STATELESS MODE
  #
  # The Consumer object keeps track of two types of state:
  #
  # 1. State of the user's current authentication attempt.  Things
  #    like the identity URL, the list of endpoints discovered for
  #    that URL, and in case where some endpoints are unreachable, the
  #    list of endpoints already tried.  This state needs to be held
  #    from Consumer.begin() to Consumer.complete(), but it is only
  #    applicable to a single session with a single user agent, and at
  #    the end of the authentication process (i.e. when an OP replies
  #    with either <tt>id_res</tt>. or <tt>cancel</tt> it may be
  #    discarded.
  #
  # 2. State of relationships with servers, i.e. shared secrets
  #    (associations) with servers and nonces seen on signed messages.
  #    This information should persist from one session to the next
  #    and should not be bound to a particular user-agent.
  #
  # These two types of storage are reflected in the first two
  # arguments of Consumer's constructor, <tt>session</tt> and
  # <tt>store</tt>.  <tt>session</tt> is a dict-like object and we
  # hope your web framework provides you with one of these bound to
  # the user agent.  <tt>store</tt> is an instance of Store.
  #
  # Since the store does hold secrets shared between your application
  # and the OpenID provider, you should be careful about how you use
  # it in a shared hosting environment.  If the filesystem or database
  # permissions of your web host allow strangers to read from them, do
  # not store your data there!  If you have no safe place to store
  # your data, construct your consumer with nil for the store, and it
  # will operate only in stateless mode.  Stateless mode may be
  # slower, put more load on the OpenID provider, and trusts the
  # provider to keep you safe from replay attacks.
  #
  # Several store implementation are provided, and the interface is
  # fully documented so that custom stores can be used as well.  See
  # the documentation for the Consumer class for more information on
  # the interface for stores.  The implementations that are provided
  # allow the consumer site to store the necessary data in several
  # different ways, including several SQL databases and normal files
  # on disk.
  #
  # = IMMEDIATE MODE
  #
  # In the flow described above, the user may need to confirm to the
  # OpenID provider that it's ok to disclose his or her identity.  The
  # provider may draw pages asking for information from the user
  # before it redirects the browser back to the consumer's site.  This
  # is generally transparent to the consumer site, so it is typically
  # ignored as an implementation detail.
  #
  # There can be times, however, where the consumer site wants to get
  # a response immediately.  When this is the case, the consumer can
  # put the library in immediate mode.  In immediate mode, there is an
  # extra response possible from the server, which is essentially the
  # server reporting that it doesn't have enough information to answer
  # the question yet.
  #
  # = USING THIS LIBRARY
  #
  # Integrating this library into an application is usually a
  # relatively straightforward process.  The process should basically
  # follow this plan:
  #
  # Add an OpenID login field somewhere on your site.  When an OpenID
  # is entered in that field and the form is submitted, it should make
  # a request to the your site which includes that OpenID URL.
  #
  # First, the application should instantiate a Consumer with a
  # session for per-user state and store for shared state using the
  # store of choice.
  #
  # Next, the application should call the <tt>begin</tt> method of
  # Consumer instance.  This method takes the OpenID URL as entered by
  # the user.  The <tt>begin</tt> method returns a CheckIDRequest
  # object.
  #
  # Next, the application should call the redirect_url method on the
  # CheckIDRequest object.  The parameter <tt>return_to</tt> is the
  # URL that the OpenID server will send the user back to after
  # attempting to verify his or her identity.  The <tt>realm</tt>
  # parameter is the URL (or URL pattern) that identifies your web
  # site to the user when he or she is authorizing it.  Send a
  # redirect to the resulting URL to the user's browser.
  #
  # That's the first half of the authentication process.  The second
  # half of the process is done after the user's OpenID Provider sends
  # the user's browser a redirect back to your site to complete their
  # login.
  #
  # When that happens, the user will contact your site at the URL
  # given as the <tt>return_to</tt> URL to the redirect_url call made
  # above.  The request will have several query parameters added to
  # the URL by the OpenID provider as the information necessary to
  # finish the request.
  #
  # Get a Consumer instance with the same session and store as before
  # and call its complete() method, passing in all the received query
  # arguments and URL currently being handled.
  #
  # There are multiple possible return types possible from that
  # method. These indicate the whether or not the login was
  # successful, and include any additional information appropriate for
  # their type.
