# ===Element Locators
# Element Locators tell Selenium which HTML element a command refers to.
# The format of a locator is:
# <em>locatorType</em><b>=</b><em>argument</em>
# We support the following strategies for locating elements:
# 
# *    <b>identifier</b>=<em>id</em>: 
# Select the element with the specified @id attribute. If no match is
# found, select the first element whose @name attribute is <em>id</em>.
# (This is normally the default; see below.)
# *    <b>id</b>=<em>id</em>:
# Select the element with the specified @id attribute.
# *    <b>name</b>=<em>name</em>:
# Select the first element with the specified @name attribute.
# *    username
# *    name=username
# 
# The name may optionally be followed by one or more <em>element-filters</em>, separated from the name by whitespace.  If the <em>filterType</em> is not specified, <b>value</b> is assumed.
# *    name=flavour value=chocolate
# 
# 
# *    <b>dom</b>=<em>javascriptExpression</em>: 
# 
# Find an element by evaluating the specified string.  This allows you to traverse the HTML Document Object
# Model using JavaScript.  Note that you must not return a value in this string; simply make it the last expression in the block.
# *    dom=document.forms['myForm'].myDropdown
# *    dom=document.images[56]
# *    dom=function foo() { return document.links[1]; }; foo();
# 
# 
# *    <b>xpath</b>=<em>xpathExpression</em>: 
# Locate an element using an XPath expression.
# *    xpath=//img[@alt='The image alt text']
# *    xpath=//table[@id='table1']//tr[4]/td[2]
# *    xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]
# *    xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]/@class
# *    xpath=(//table[@class='stylee'])//th[text()='theHeaderText']/../td
# *    xpath=//input[@name='name2' and @value='yes']
# *    xpath=//*[text()="right"]
# 
# 
# *    <b>link</b>=<em>textPattern</em>:
# Select the link (anchor) element which contains text matching the
# specified <em>pattern</em>.
# *    link=The link text
# 
# 
# *    <b>css</b>=<em>cssSelectorSyntax</em>:
# Select the element using css selectors. Please refer to CSS2 selectors, CSS3 selectors for more information. You can also check the TestCssLocators test in the selenium test suite for an example of usage, which is included in the downloaded selenium core package.
# *    css=a[href="#id3"]
# *    css=span#firstChild + span
# 
# Currently the css selector locator supports all css1, css2 and css3 selectors except namespace in css3, some pseudo classes(:nth-of-type, :nth-last-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :only-of-type, :visited, :hover, :active, :focus, :indeterminate) and pseudo elements(::first-line, ::first-letter, ::selection, ::before, ::after). 
# 
# *    <b>ui</b>=<em>uiSpecifierString</em>:
# Locate an element by resolving the UI specifier string to another locator, and evaluating it. See the Selenium UI-Element Reference for more details.
# *    ui=loginPages::loginButton()
# *    ui=settingsPages::toggle(label=Hide Email)
# *    ui=forumPages::postBody(index=2)//a[2]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Without an explicit locator prefix, Selenium uses the following default
# strategies:
# 
# *    <b>dom</b>, for locators starting with "document."
# *    <b>xpath</b>, for locators starting with "//"
# *    <b>identifier</b>, otherwise
# 
# ===Element FiltersElement filters can be used with a locator to refine a list of candidate elements.  They are currently used only in the 'name' element-locator.
# Filters look much like locators, ie.
# <em>filterType</em><b>=</b><em>argument</em>Supported element-filters are:
# <b>value=</b><em>valuePattern</em>
# 
# Matches elements based on their values.  This is particularly useful for refining a list of similarly-named toggle-buttons.<b>index=</b><em>index</em>
# 
# Selects a single element based on its position in the list (offset from zero).===String-match Patterns
# Various Pattern syntaxes are available for matching string values:
# 
# *    <b>glob:</b><em>pattern</em>:
# Match a string against a "glob" (aka "wildmat") pattern. "Glob" is a
# kind of limited regular-expression syntax typically used in command-line
# shells. In a glob pattern, "*" represents any sequence of characters, and "?"
# represents any single character. Glob patterns match against the entire
# string.
# *    <b>regexp:</b><em>regexp</em>:
# Match a string using a regular-expression. The full power of JavaScript
# regular-expressions is available.
# *    <b>regexpi:</b><em>regexpi</em>:
# Match a string using a case-insensitive regular-expression.
# *    <b>exact:</b><em>string</em>:
# 
# Match a string exactly, verbatim, without any of that fancy wildcard
# stuff.
# 
# 
# If no pattern prefix is specified, Selenium assumes that it's a "glob"
# pattern.
# 
# 
# For commands that return multiple values (such as verifySelectOptions),
# the string being matched is a comma-separated list of the return values,
# where both commas and backslashes in the values are backslash-escaped.
# When providing a pattern, the optional matching syntax (i.e. glob,
# regexp, etc.) is specified once, as usual, at the beginning of the
# pattern.

        # 
        #

        # Window locators provide different ways of specifying the window object:
        # by title, by internal JavaScript "name," or by JavaScript variable.
        # 
        # *    <b>title</b>=<em>My Special Window</em>:
        # Finds the window using the text that appears in the title bar.  Be careful;
        # two windows can share the same title.  If that happens, this locator will
        # just pick one.
        # 
        # *    <b>name</b>=<em>myWindow</em>:
        # Finds the window using its internal JavaScript "name" property.  This is the second 
        # parameter "windowName" passed to the JavaScript method window.open(url, windowName, windowFeatures, replaceFlag)
        # (which Selenium intercepts).
        # 
        # *    <b>var</b>=<em>variableName</em>:
        # Some pop-up windows are unnamed (anonymous), but are associated with a JavaScript variable name in the current
        # application window, e.g. "window.foo = window.open(url);".  In those cases, you can open the window using
        # "var=foo".
        # 
        # 
        # 
        # If no window locator prefix is provided, we'll try to guess what you mean like this:
        # 1.) if windowID is null, (or the string "null") then it is assumed the user is referring to the original window instantiated by the browser).
        # 2.) if the value of the "windowID" parameter is a JavaScript variable name in the current application window, then it is assumed
        # that this variable contains the return value from a call to the JavaScript window.open() method.
        # 3.) Otherwise, selenium looks in a hash it maintains that maps string names to window "names".
        # 4.) If <em>that</em> fails, we'll try looping over all of the known windows to try to find the appropriate "title".
        # Since "title" is not necessarily unique, this may have unexpected behavior.
        # If you're having trouble figuring out the name of a window that you want to manipulate, look at the Selenium log messages
        # which identify the names of windows created via window.open (and therefore intercepted by Selenium).  You will see messages
        # like the following for each window as it is opened:
        # <tt>debug: window.open call intercepted; window ID (which you can use with selectWindow()) is "myNewWindow"</tt>

        # *    If <tt>windowID</tt> is either not specified, or specified as
        # "null", the first non-top window is selected. The top window is the one
        # that would be selected by <tt>selectWindow()</tt> without providing a
