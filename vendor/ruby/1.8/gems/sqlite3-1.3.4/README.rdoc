= SQLite3/Ruby Interface

* http://github.com/luislavena/sqlite3-ruby

== DESCRIPTION

This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite3
database engine (http://www.sqlite.org).  You must have the
SQLite engine installed in order to build this module.

Note that this module is NOT compatible with SQLite 2.x.

== SYNOPSIS

  require "sqlite3"
  
  # Open a database
  db = SQLite3::Database.new "test.db"
  
  # Create a database
  rows = db.execute <<-SQL
    create table numbers (
      name varchar(30),
      val int
    );
  SQL
  
  # Execute a few inserts
  {
    "one" => 1,
    "two" => 2,
  }.each do |pair|
    db.execute "insert into numbers values ( ?, ? )", pair
  end
  
  # Find a few rows
  db.execute( "select * from numbers" ) do |row|
    p row
  end


== Compilation and Installation

Install SQLite3, enabling option SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA (see
www.sqlite.org/compile.html for details).

Then do the following:

  ruby setup.rb config
  ruby setup.rb setup
  ruby setup.rb install

Alternatively, you can download and install the RubyGem package for
SQLite3/Ruby (you must have RubyGems and SQLite3 installed, first):

  gem install sqlite3

If you have sqlite3 installed in a non-standard location, you can specify the location of the include and lib files by doing:

  gem install sqlite3 -- --with-sqlite3-include=/opt/local/include \
     --with-sqlite3-lib=/opt/local/lib
