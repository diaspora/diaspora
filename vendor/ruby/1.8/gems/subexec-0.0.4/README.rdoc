= Subexec

=== Description

Subexec is a simple library that spawns an external command with
an optional timeout parameter. It relies on Ruby 1.9's Process.spawn
method. Also, it works with synchronous and asynchronous code.

Useful for libraries that are Ruby wrappers for CLI's. For example,
resizing images with ImageMagick's mogrify command sometimes stalls
and never returns control back to the original process. Enter Subexec.

=== Usage

  sub = Subexec.run "echo 'hello' && sleep 3", :timeout => 5
  puts sub.output     # returns: hello
  puts sub.exitstatus # returns: 0

  sub = Subexec.run "echo 'hello' && sleep 3", :timeout => 1
  puts sub.output     # returns: 
  puts sub.exitstatus # returns:


=== Limitations

Only Ruby 1.9 can spawn non-blocking subprocesses, via Process.spawn.
So Ruby 1.8 support is sheerly for backwards compatibility.
