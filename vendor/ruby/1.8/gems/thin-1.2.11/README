== Thin
Tiny, fast & funny HTTP server

Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history:
* the Mongrel parser: the root of Mongrel speed and security
* Event Machine: a network I/O library with extremely high scalability, performance and stability
* Rack: a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks

Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.

=== Installation
For the latest stable version:

 sudo gem install thin

Or from source:

 git clone git://github.com/macournoyer/thin.git
 cd thin
 rake install

=== Usage
A +thin+ script offers an easy way to start your Rails application:

 cd to/your/rails/app
 thin start

But Thin is also usable with a Rack config file.
You need to setup a config.ru file and pass it to the thin script:
  
 cat config.ru
 app = proc do |env|
  [
    200,
    {
      'Content-Type' => 'text/html',
      'Content-Length' => '2'
    },
    ['hi']
  ]
 end
 
 run app

 thin start -R config.ru
 
See example directory for more samples and run 'thin -h' for usage.
