Treetop is a language for describing languages. Combining the elegance of Ruby with cutting-edge <em>parsing expression grammars</em>, it helps you analyze syntax with revolutionary ease.

<h1>Intuitive Grammar Specifications</h1>

<p>Parsing expression grammars (PEGs) are simple to write and easy to maintain. They are a simple but powerful generalization of regular expressions that are easier to work with than the LALR or LR-1 grammars of traditional parser generators. There's no need for a tokenization phase, and <em>lookahead assertions</em> can be used for a limited degree of context-sensitivity. Here's an extremely simple Treetop grammar that matches a subset of arithmetic, respecting operator precedence:</p>

<pre><code>grammar Arithmetic
  rule additive
    multitive ( '+' multitive )*
  end

  rule multitive
    primary ( [*/%] primary )*
  end

  rule primary
    '(' additive ')' / number
  end

  rule number
    '-'? [1-9] [0-9]*
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h1>Syntax-Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>Rather than implementing semantic actions that construct parse trees, Treetop lets you define methods on trees that it constructs for you automatically. You can define these methods directly within the grammar...</p>

<pre><code>grammar Arithmetic
  rule additive
    multitive a:( '+' multitive )* {
      def value
        a.elements.inject(multitive.value) { |sum, e|
          sum+e.multitive.value
        }
      end
    }
  end

  # other rules below ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>...or associate rules with classes of nodes you wish your parsers to instantiate upon matching a rule.</p>

<pre><code>grammar Arithmetic
  rule additive
    multitive ('+' multitive)* &lt;AdditiveNode&gt;
  end

  # other rules below ...
end
</code></pre>

<h1>Reusable, Composable Language Descriptions</h1>

<p>Because PEGs are closed under composition, Treetop grammars can be treated like Ruby modules. You can mix them into one another and override rules with access to the <code>super</code> keyword. You can break large grammars down into coherent units or make your language's syntax modular. This is especially useful if you want other programmers to be able to reuse your work.</p>

<pre><code>grammar RubyWithEmbeddedSQL
  include SQL

  rule string
    quote sql_expression quote / super
  end
end
</code></pre>
