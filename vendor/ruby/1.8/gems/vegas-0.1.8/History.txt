== 0.1.1 2009-11-18

* Repackaged with Jeweler, fixed dependency issues and removed other dev artifacts

== 0.1.0 2009-08-30

* New:
  * options[:start] = false will keep the app from actually starting (useful for defining your own start/stop commands)
  * options[:launch_path] Takes a string or an object that responds to call (proc/lambda) that gets the runner as its only argument. This allows you to easily manipulate options or args to launch the app to a specific path. See latest gembox for example.
* Changed:
  * Sinatra is no longer a dependency! Vegas can now run pure Rack apps.
  * All methods for starting an app are grouped into Runner#start
  * launch! and start both take an optional path string to launch the app to.
