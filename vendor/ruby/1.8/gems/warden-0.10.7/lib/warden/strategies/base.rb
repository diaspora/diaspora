  module Strategies
    # A strategy is a place where you can put logic related to authentication. Any strategy inherits
    # from Warden::Strategies::Base.
    #
    # The Warden::Strategies.add method is a simple way to provide custom strategies.
    # You _must_ declare an @authenticate!@ method.
    # You _may_ provide a @valid?@ method.
    # The valid method should return true or false depending on if the strategy is a valid one for the request.
    #
    # The parameters for Warden::Strategies.add method is:
    #   <label: Symbol> The label is the name given to a strategy.  Use the label to refer to the strategy when authenticating
    #   <strategy: Class|nil> The optional stragtegy argument if set _must_ be a class that inherits from Warden::Strategies::Base and _must_
    #                         implement an @authenticate!@ method
    #   <block> The block acts as a convinient way to declare your strategy.  Inside is the class definition of a strategy.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   Block Declared Strategy:
    #    Warden::Strategies.add(:foo) do
    #      def authenticate!
    #        # authentication logic
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    #    Class Declared Strategy:
    #      Warden::Strategies.add(:foo, MyStrategy)
