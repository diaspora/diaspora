    # A callback hook set to run every time after a user is set.
    # This callback is triggered the first time one of those three events happens
    # during a request: :authentication, :fetch (from session) and :set_user (when manually set).
    # You can supply as many hooks as you like, and they will be run in order of decleration.
    #
    # If you want to run the callbacks for a given scope and/or event, you can specify them as options.
    # See parameters and example below.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # <options> Some options which specify when the callback should be executed
    #   scope  - Executes the callback only if it maches the scope(s) given
    #   only   - Executes the callback only if it matches the event(s) given
    #   except - Executes the callback except if it matches the event(s) given
    # <block> A block where you can set arbitrary logic to run every time a user is set
    #   Block Parameters: |user, auth, opts|
    #     user - The user object that is being set
    #     auth - The raw authentication proxy object.
    #     opts - any options passed into the set_user call includeing :scope
    #
    # Example:
    #   Warden::Manager.after_set_user do |user,auth,opts|
    #     scope = opts[:scope]
    #     if auth.session["#{scope}.last_access"].to_i > (Time.now - 5.minutes)
    #       auth.logout(scope)
    #       throw(:warden, :scope => scope, :reason => "Times Up")
    #     end
    #     auth.session["#{scope}.last_access"] = Time.now
    #   end
    #
    #   Warden::Manager.after_set_user :except => :fetch do |user,auth,opts|
    #     user.login_count += 1

    # A callback that runs just prior to the failur application being called.
    # This callback occurs after PATH_INFO has been modified for the failure (default /unauthenticated)
    # In this callback you can mutate the environment as required by the failure application
    # If a Rails controller were used for the failure_app for example, you would need to set request[:params][:action] = :unauthenticated
    #
    # Parameters:
    # <options> Some options which specify when the callback should be executed

    # <block> A block to contain logic for the callback
    #   Block Parameters: |env, opts|
    #     env - The rack env hash
    #     opts - any options passed into the authenticate call includeing :scope
    #
    # Example:
    #   Warden::Manager.before_failure do |env, opts|
