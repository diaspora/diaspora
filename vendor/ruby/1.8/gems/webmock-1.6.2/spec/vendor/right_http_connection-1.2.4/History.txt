    objects to S3

* r2764, konstantin, 02-08-08 00:05:00 +03:00
  * "RightAws: incompatible Net::HTTP monkey-patch" exception is raised if our net_fix
    patch was overriden (by attachment_fu for example, to avoid this load attachment_fu

  the seek pointer for the subsequent re-request

                  The error occurred while evaluating nil.body_stream>
