# Glossary

* **Code Object**: Any explicitly defined Ruby source that describes a feature
  of the code. By default, this refers to classes, modules, methods, constants
  and class variables, though it can be extended to refer to custom functionality
  defined by a DSL (like a spec, for instance).

* **Domain Specific Language (DSL)**: In the context of Ruby, a DSL is a languge
  optimized for a specific domain (problem) but represented using Ruby syntax.

* **Docstring (Documentation String)**: Comments associated with a code object
  used for documentation purposes.
