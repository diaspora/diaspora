    # Handlers are pluggable semantic parsers for YARD's code generation
    # phase. They allow developers to control what information gets
    # generated by YARD, giving them the ability to, for instance, document
    # any Ruby DSLs that a customized framework may use. A good example
    # of this would be the ability to document and generate meta data for
    # the 'describe' declaration of the RSpec testing framework by simply
    # adding a handler for such a keyword. Similarly, any Ruby API that
    # takes advantage of class level declarations could add these to the
    # documentation in a very explicit format by treating them as first-
    # class objects in any outputted documentation.
    #
    # == Overview of a Typical Handler Scenario
    #
    # Generally, a handler class will declare a set of statements which
    # it will handle using the {handles} class declaration. It will then
    # implement the {#process} method to do the work. The processing would
    # usually involve the manipulation of the {#namespace}, {#owner}
    # {CodeObjects::Base code objects} or the creation of new ones, in
    # which case they should be registered by {#register}, a method that
    # sets some basic attributes for the new objects.
    #
    # Handlers are usually simple and take up to a page of code to process
    # and register a new object or add new attributes to the current +namespace+.
    #
    # == Setting up a Handler for Use
    #
    # A Handler is automatically registered when it is subclassed from the
    # base class. The only other thing that needs to be done is to specify
    # which statement the handler will process. This is done with the +handles+
    # declaration, taking either a {Parser::Ruby::Legacy::RubyToken}, {String} or `Regexp`.
    # Here is a simple example which processes module statements.
    #
    #   class MyModuleHandler < YARD::Handlers::Base
    #     handles TkMODULE
    #
    #     def process
    #       # do something
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # == Processing Handler Data
    #
    # The goal of a specific handler is really up to the developer, and as
    # such there is no real guideline on how to process the data. However,
    # it is important to know where the data is coming from to be able to use
    # it.
    #
    # === +statement+ Attribute
    #
    # The +statement+ attribute pertains to the {Parser::Ruby::Legacy::Statement} object
    # containing a set of tokens parsed in by the parser. This is the main set
    # of data to be analyzed and processed. The comments attached to the statement
    # can be accessed by the {Parser::Ruby::Legacy::Statement#comments} method, but generally
    # the data to be processed will live in the +tokens+ attribute. This list
    # can be converted to a +String+ using +#to_s+ to parse the data with
    # regular expressions (or other text processing mechanisms), if needed.
    #
    # === +namespace+ Attribute
    #
    # The +namespace+ attribute is a {CodeObjects::NamespaceObject namespace object}
    # which represents the current namespace that the parser is in. For instance:
    #
    #   module SomeModule
    #     class MyClass
    #       def mymethod; end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If a handler was to parse the 'class MyClass' statement, it would
    # be necessary to know that it belonged inside the SomeModule module.
    # This is the value that +namespace+ would return when processing such
    # a statement. If the class was then entered and another handler was
    # called on the method, the +namespace+ would be set to the 'MyClass'
    # code object.
    #
    # === +owner+ Attribute
    #
    # The +owner+ attribute is similar to the +namespace+ attribute in that
    # it also follows the scope of the code during parsing. However, a namespace
    # object is loosely defined as a module or class and YARD has the ability
    # to parse beyond module and class blocks (inside methods, for instance),
    # so the +owner+ attribute would not be limited to modules and classes.
    #
    # To put this into context, the example from above will be used. If a method
    # handler was added to the mix and decided to parse inside the method body,
    # the +owner+ would be set to the method object but the namespace would remain
    # set to the class. This would allow the developer to process any method
    # definitions set inside a method (def x; def y; 2 end end) by adding them
    # to the correct namespace (the class, not the method).
    #
    # In summary, the distinction between +namespace+ and +owner+ can be thought
    # of as the difference between first-class Ruby objects (namespaces) and
    # second-class Ruby objects (methods).
    #
    # === +visibility+ and +scope+ Attributes
    #
    # Mainly needed for parsing methods, the +visibility+ and +scope+ attributes
    # refer to the public/protected/private and class/instance values (respectively)
    # of the current parsing position.
    #
    # == Parsing Blocks in Statements
    #
    # In addition to parsing a statement and creating new objects, some
    # handlers may wish to continue parsing the code inside the statement's
    # block (if there is one). In this context, a block means the inside
    # of any statement, be it class definition, module definition, if
    # statement or classic 'Ruby block'.
    #
    # For example, a class statement would be "class MyClass" and the block
    # would be a list of statements including the method definitions inside
    # the class. For a class handler, the programmer would execute the
    # {#parse_block} method to continue parsing code inside the block, with
    # the +namespace+ now pointing to the class object the handler created.
    #
    # YARD has the ability to continue into any block: class, module, method,
    # even if statements. For this reason, the block parsing method must be
    # invoked explicitly out of efficiency sake.
